The rank is determined whether you are\nabove or below the average of five. For each rank above the average, you gain\none positive modifier, and for each rank below average you gain a minus rank.\n\n\nFor example Jack has a seven strength, which means he has a plus two modifier\nin strength. Whenever Jack does a task related to strength, he can add the plus\ntwo modifier to his roll.\n\n\n Strength\n\n\nStrength represents your raw physical power. It determines not\nonly how much a character can lift, drag or push; but also how far he can jump,\nor how much damage he does in melee combat.\n\n\n Dexterity\n\n\nDexterity determines your characters fine motor skills and how\nwell your hand-eye coordination is. It is used in combat with fire arms, and\nother skills that require a steady hand, such as piloting a vessel or performing\nsurgery.\n\n\n Constitution\n\n\nConstitution determines the physical wellness of your\ncharacter. It determines your hit points, as well as endurance and overall\nfitness and health of your character.\n\n\n Intelligence\n\n\nIntelligence represents how well and fast your character\nlearns, how well he can think logically, or in abstract terms. It is important\nfor the sciences and other academic fields.\n\n\n Perception\n\n\nPerception is the awareness of your character. It describes\nhow well your character can describe his surroundings, either passively or\nactively. It determines how well the character finds things that are hidden,\nor notices danger.\n\n\n Charisma\n\n\nCharisma determines how well your character can interact with\nothers.

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nEverything in Endless Horizons is done by making a \ncheck\n against a given\n\ndifficulty\n. It is the player\ns job to make the check, while it is the game\nmasters job to keep track of the difficulty. When bonuses or penalties are\ngiven in tihs document, they usually apply to the difficulty and \nnot the check\n\nthat the player makes.\n\n\nThis is important as the player probably does not, and should not, know all\nthe factors that make his work harder or easier. As a game master you should\nalways be as transparent as possible, when it comes to determining the\ndifficulty.\n\n\nAlthough the rules are rather specific for most circumstances, the game master\nshould always adjust the difficulty of tasks according the specific situation.\nFor example, a fog can add from +1 to +6 to the difficulty of a task, to\nidentify another person depending on how thick the fog is.\n\n\nRolling\n\n\nAlmost all of the skill checks in Endless Horizons are done by rolling a ten\nsided die (d10). The player adds relevant bonuses from his her character,\nwhile the game master calculates the difficulty. If the player\ns result is\nat or above the difficulty the check is successful.\n\n\nIf the player rolls a one (1) or a ten (10) he has caused the dice to escalate.\nThe player rolls again until either he rolls a number that is not one or ten,\nor until he has rolled three times in total. Rolling a ten gives a minor\npositive effect, rolling a one adds minor negative effect. Rolling two tens or\ntwo ones in a row adds a medium positive or negative effect; and rolling three\nones or tens in a row adds a major positive or negative effect to the outcome\noff the task.\n\n\nPositive and negative effects cancel each other out. So if the player rolls a\none, and then rolls a ten; these two effects cancel each other. If the player\nrolls a ten, then another ten and finally a one, the result is just minor\npositive effect as one \nten\n and the \none\n cancel each other.\n\n\nA check is not automatically failed when rolling a one. A check only fails if\nthe result does not meet the difficulty.\n\n\nEffects\n\n\nWhen the player achieves a minor, medium or major effect it is up the game\nmaster to decide what happens. These effects happen regardless of whether the\ncheck succeeds or not.\n\n\nMinor positive effects grant a small immediate bonus (for example extra\ndamage, or the task is done faster), while minor negative effects do the\nopposite. For example a task could take longer to complete, or the player\ndoes less damage than normal.\n\n\nMedium effects give major bonuses (for example they might take down the target\noutright) or major disadvantages, for example the weapon jams and needs to be\ncleared and reloaded before it is usable again.\n\n\nMajor effects are relatively rare, but may bring devastating results not only\nfor the player in question but maybe also for others around him, or allow him\nto achieve the seemingly impossible.\n\n\nExample: The player wishes to shoot a small burst with his rifle against a\ntarget down the hallway. He rolls a 1, but after all the bonuses are added\nthe GM determines that he hits. The player rolls again (a 6) and breaks the\nescalating die. He hits, although with a minor negative effect. The game\nmaster decided that in the heat of battle the player overshot, and spent\nmore bullets than he intended. The player shot a burst of ten instead of five,\nyet none of the extra bullets hit any enemies.\n\n\nContests\n\n\nWhen two players, or a player and an NPC, use their skills against each other,\nthey are rolling in a contest. Both players pitch their respectives rolls\nagainst each other, applying relevant bonuses, and whoever has the highest\nresult wins. On a draw, the party who initiated the contest wins.\n\n\nApplying Effort\n\n\nOn all rolls of the dice that determine an outcome for the player, the player\nmay spend effort points. He has to declare so, before making the\nroll. The amount of effort he wishes to spend must not exceed his\nremaining effort pool.

This is important as the player probably does not, and should not, know all\nthe factors that make his work harder or easier. As a game master you should\nalways be as transparent as possible, when it comes to determining the\ndifficulty.  Although the rules are rather specific for most circumstances, the game master\nshould always adjust the difficulty of tasks according the specific situation.\nFor example, a fog can add from +1 to +6 to the difficulty of a task, to\nidentify another person depending on how thick the fog is.",

If the player rolls a one (1) or a ten (10) he has caused the dice to escalate.\nThe player rolls again until either he rolls a number that is not one or ten,\nor until he has rolled three times in total. Rolling a ten gives a minor\npositive effect, rolling a one adds minor negative effect. Rolling two tens or\ntwo ones in a row adds a medium positive or negative effect; and rolling three\nones or tens in a row adds a major positive or negative effect to the outcome\noff the task.  Positive and negative effects cancel each other out. So if the player rolls a\none, and then rolls a ten; these two effects cancel each other. If the player\nrolls a ten, then another ten and finally a one, the result is just minor\npositive effect as one  ten  and the  one  cancel each other.

Minor positive effects grant a small immediate bonus (for example extra\ndamage, or the task is done faster), while minor negative effects do the\nopposite. For example a task could take longer to complete, or the player\ndoes less damage than normal.  Medium effects give major bonuses (for example they might take down the target\noutright) or major disadvantages, for example the weapon jams and needs to be\ncleared and reloaded before it is usable again.  Major effects are relatively rare, but may bring devastating results not only\nfor the player in question but maybe also for others around him, or allow him\nto achieve the seemingly impossible.  Example: The player wishes to shoot a small burst with his rifle against a\ntarget down the hallway. He rolls a 1, but after all the bonuses are added\nthe GM determines that he hits. The player rolls again (a 6) and breaks the\nescalating die. He hits, although with a minor negative effect.

Ship to ship\ncombat is defined in its own section in the chapter that deals with Vessels.\n\n\nActions\n\n\nEvery participant in combat may choose to take three actions per turn. The\nparticipant can take 1 \naction\n, 1 \nreaction\n and 1 \nfree action\n. Perks,\nitems or other specialties of a character may modify the amount of actions he\nor she may take.\n\n\nActions are activities the player may choose to perform during his turn. Be it\nshooting or aiming a firearm, performing a skill check or running across a\nhallway to reach an elevator. Valid actions are:\n\n\n\n\nUse the character\ns speed points for movement.\n\n\nUse a non-complicated item, like reloading a firearm, pull the pin and\n  throwing a grenade etc.\n\n\nAttack an enemy.\n\n\nAim at an enemy.\n\n\nPerform a skill check.\n\n\n\n\nA \nreaction\n is an action that is only performed if a certain condition is\nfulfilled. The reaction is valid until the next turn of the character who\ndeclared it. If its condition does not kick in, the action is lost. If the\ncondition kicks, in the player begins his action during the action that\ntriggered it.\n\n\nSometimes the game master may wish to declare a contest between the participant\nthat does the action and the one that does the reaction. For example, one\nparticipant has a reaction in place to draw his gun, if the opponent reaches\nfor his firearm. The game master decides that a dexterity challenge is required\nto determine who draws first. Both players roll a ten sided dice and add any\ndexterity modifier to the result.

            "text": "Ranged Combat\n\n\nRanged combat works differently. A player chooses to engage another in ranged\ncombat, takes aim and fires. The player who is being targeted has no chance\nusually has little change to evade (except on extreme distances). The difficulty\nof landing a successful hit depends on several factors:\n\n\n\n\nSize: The difficulty increases if the target is smaller or decreases if the\ntarget is bigger.\n\n\nRange: Depending on the weapon in question, targets get harder to hit at\nlonger ranges.\n\n\nStances: Various stances can decrease the difficulty. A person firing a\nfully automatic rifle while standing, has a low chance of hitting than a\nperson who fires single shots from the prone position.\n\n\nMovement: A moving target is hard to hit, especially at further ranges. This\nalso applies if the shooter is moving while trying to aim.\n\n\nEnvironmental: Darkness, strong winds and impaired vision can all affect on how\nwell a character can hit a target.\n\n\n\n\nThe game master calculates the difficulty of the task depending on these factors\nand player rolls an appropriate skill check. If he reaches it or exceeds the\ndifficulty he scores a hit.\n\n\nCover\n\n\nThe best way to protect oneself from fire is to hide beneath or behind cover.\nDepending on the material of the cover bullets may still be able to penetrate\nthe cover and cause damage to the people behind the cover.\n\n\nFor example most bullets can penetrate a wooden cover, whereas a .50 BMG is even\ncapable of tearing through brick walls.\n\n\nSize\n\n\nThe game separates targets into size categories. An average human standing is\nconsidered a \nmedium\n target. The same average human that is either sitting on\nthe floor or kneeling is considered a \nsmall\n target. The same person in the\nprone position is considered \ntiny\n. These size categories do not change\ndepending on the distance from the shooter. They just help to categorize the\ntargets. For example a big dog would be considered a \nsmall\n target, while a\nsneaking would count as \ntiny\n.\n\n\nTargets larger than a human also have their own size categories. A car, for\nexample is considered a \nlarge\n target. So are some other vehicles that fit\nroughly the same size. Bigger targets are considered \nhuge\n, for example large\nvehicles (main battle tanks, MRAPs, IVFs) or even space ships.\n\n\nRange\n\n\nThe range to a target is always given rough estimate in metres. The game master\nshould avoid making a science of it, and should operate in rough estimates.\n\n\nThe gun play mechanics then categorize these ranges into what is called an\n\neffective range\n. This is a metric used in conjunction\nwith firearms to determine how effective they are at certain ranges. The authors\nknow that firearms are more complicated than that, and much of it depends on the\nskill of the shooter involved. Still this metric is used for abstraction and for\nbalancing reasons.\n\n\nThe \neffective range\n is broadly defined as the distance an average shooter\nshould be able to hit a \nmedium\n target half of the time. Other ranges are\nderived from this in fractions:\n\n\n\n\nMaximum\n: Between \neffective range\n and half the \neffective range\n.\n\n\nFar\n: Between \nmaximum\n and a quarter of the \neffective range\n.\n\n\nMedium\n: Between \nfar\n and an eights of the \neffective range\n.\n\n\nClose\n: Below an eights of the \neffective range\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, let\ns assume a Glock 17 has an effective range of 50 metres. The\nranges are thus as following: \nMaximum\n is between 50 and 25 metres. \nFar\n\nbetween 25 and 12.5 metres. \nMedium\n between 12.5 metres and six metres, and\n\nclose\n is everything closer than six metres.\n\n\nThe size category of the target and the range category are combined and lead\nto the following table of penalties for the difficulty task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nClose\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nFar\n\n\nMaximum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiny\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n+1\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n-12\n\n\n-8\n\n\n-4\n\n\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge\n\n\n-18\n\n\n-12\n\n\n-6\n\n\n-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovement\n\n\nMovement is also categorized into four categories: \nstill\n, \nsubtle\n, \nslow\n\nand \nfast\n. A normal human being standing is considered moving \nsubtly\n as no\nperson normally stands perfectly still. Objects may as well stand perfectly\n\nstill\n, as in their movement is not noticeable. So do living beings who are\nperhaps bound, unconscious or otherwise incapable of moving. \nSlow\n movement\nincorporates anything at the speed of an average human walking. \nFast\n is\nanything that moves at a speed of an average human sprinting or above.\n\n\nThe penalties are as followed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill\n\n\nSubtle\n\n\nSlow\n\n\nFast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2\n\n\n0\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese penalties apply for both a moving target, and a shooter that is moving. So\na player who is running and shooting at a target that is also running as a\ncumulative penalty of plus eight (+8).\n\n\nStance\n\n\nA person firing can be in one of the following firing stances: \nstanding\n,\n\nkneeling\n, \nprone firing\n, and \nprone\n. Standing also makes the person in\nquestion a medium target, \nkneeling\n makes him a small and \nprone\n and\n\nprone firing\n a tiny target.\n\n\nThe difference between \nprone\n and \nprone firing\n is that a prone firing is an\nactual rifle stance. The prone firing position gives an aiming advantage,\nwhile prone does not. If a person falls on the floor, or is knocked down he is\nconsidered \nprone\n instead of being in the \nprone firing\n position.\n\n\nThe penalties for the stances are as followed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStance\n\n\nPenalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKneeling\n\n\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProne firing\n\n\n-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProne\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking Aim\n\n\nA character is always considered to at least raise is weapon, aim shortly and\nthe fire by default.\n\n\nBut a character may expend an action to take careful aim. The difficulty is\nreduced by two (2) for each action he chooses to take aim for. The bonus is lost\nif he doesn\nt fire in the same round he also take aim for.\n\n\nBursts and Full Auto\n\n\nEach weapon which is capable of burst firing or fully automatic has a recoil\nmodifier. Each subsequent bullet adds this recoil modifier to the difficulty.\nRegardless only one attack roll is made for the burst. As many bullets of the\nburst hit as the attack roll meets or exceeds in difficulty. While the\nprogression is linear (per bullet) in a real life scenario it is perfectly\nreasonable for the first bullet to hit, the second to miss and the third to\nhit again.\n\n\nExample: A player wishes to shoot a three round burst at a target. The\ndifficulty is determined to be 16 and the recoil modifier of the gun is 2.\nThe player rolls a 19. This means that the first bullet (difficulty 16) hits,\nthe second does as well (as the player\ns 19 is above 16 plus 2) but the third\nbullet does not (19 is below 20).\n\n\nSuppressing Fire\n\n\nSometimes it is necessary to keep the enemy sitting ducks. Usually to allow\nsomeone else to flank around, or to cover the get away of others. With\nsuppressing fire you have to fire a certain amount bullets towards the\nenemies you wish to suppress for each action you wish to suppress them. This\nincludes your actions, those of your allies and the actions of the enemy. The\namount of bullets required is determined by the game master. Depending on the\nsituation. The game master may even allow you to fire and aim at an enemy out of\nturn if they leave their cover while you suppress them.\n\n\nIf you run out of bullets and have to reload you have to await your turn to\nreload and the suppression ends.\n\n\nThe game master has to determine the bullets required. For example, covering a\nsimple narrow corridor (with enemies left and right of the door) usually\nrequires just one bullets per action. While a wide open area with natural\ncover and enemies advancing may require a short burst per cover.\n\n\nThe rule of thumb is, that one shooter with one bullet per action can\neffectively suppress one lane of attack (i.e. one hallway, one street). If\nthe area is wide and open, a small burst (of three to five bullets) is usually\nrequired to keep one group of advancing enemies at bay.\n\n\nDespite common misconception it is not required to fire full auto to achieve\na suppression effect. If a sharp shooter covers a narrow side alley and takes\nsingle shots at anyone who wishes to cross, the enemies will still think twice\nbefore crossing.\n\n\nReloading\n\n\nReloading a firearms takes a certain amount of actions. If not otherwise noted\nin the description of the firearm, it takes one action to reload the firearm.\n\n\nIf the firearm uses magazines, that means swapping the empty magazine for a new\none and cocking the gun. Reloading magazines themselves is generally not\npossible during a firefight.\n\n\nDrawing\n\n\nDrawing a pistol or a knife from a holster takes one action. The same applies\nif you carry the pistol or knife conceiled on your body (but still using a\nholster). The same applies if you carry the knife or the pistol in a slot of\na body armor.\n\n\nIf the weapon is not in a slot of an armor, or in a holster (i.e. hidden in\na boot, in your pocket, a rucksack or shouldered) it takes two actions to\ndraw the weapon.\n\n\nHiding\n\n\nYou can hide small weapons (Pistols, PDWs) on your body. This is not the same\nas doing conceiled carry. Use your \nstealth\n skill to hide the weapon on\nyour body. Anybody searching you must use an apposing \nnotice\n check to\nfind the hidden weapon on you, but gains a -5 on his difficulty task, as finding\na weapon is easier than hiding one. If someone wishes to determine from a\ndistance if you are armed or not, he must also make a \nnotice\n check, but does\nnot gain any benefit.\n\n\nMalfunctions\n\n\nFirearms are mechanical devices that can fail. Wear and tear, or inproper\ncleaning and handling can contribute to these malfunctions or stoppages. There\nare variety of possible malfunctions, ranging from temporary to relative save\nmalfunctions to potentially dangerous ones that can permanently damage the gun\nor cause injury or death.\n\n\nThese malfunctions are candidates for minor or medium negative effects.\n\n\nA minor fault is a \nfailure to feed\n (FTF) when the firearm fails to feed\nthe next cartridge into the chamber from a magazine. It can also be caused by\nnot holding the fire arm properly (``limp wristing\n). It can usually be cleared\nin one action and does not immediately threaten the shooter. It does however\nstop a burst or fully automatic fire.\n\n\nA stovepipe (\nfailure to eject\n) occours when the spent casing is not\nproperly ejected from the firearm, causing it to jam the ejection port. It\npresents no immediate danger to the shooter and can be cleared in one action. It\ndoes however stop a burst or fully automatic fire.\n\n\nA severe major fault is a so called \nsquib load\n where the projectile does\nnot have enough force to exit the barrel and becomes stuck. A subsequent bullet\nfired afterwards can cause catastrophic failure, causing damage to the firearm\nand injury to the shooter.\n\n\nDetermining Difficulty\n\n\nThe base difficulty for ranged attacks is five (5). Then you combine the size\ncategory and the range category and add it. Then you add a movement penalty,\nif the target is moving or the shooter is moving. Then you add stance modifiers,\nany environmental modifiers and any miscellaneous modifiers.\n\n\nExample\n: A player wishes to fire a three round burst with his rifle\n(recoil modifier of 2) (range 300 metres) at a small target roughly 100 metres\nout. It is dusk and the game master decides that he has an additional penalty\nof +2 for from low light conditions. The player as a dexterity and perception\nmodifier of +1, and three ranks in the appropriate skill. The difficulty is\ndetermined as following:\n\n\n\nDC = \n5\n\n\n+ 8\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n- 1\n\n= 13\n\n\n\n\nThe player rolls the following:\n\n\n\n1d10 = \n8\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n+ 3\n\n= 13\n\n\n\n\nAnd scores one hit. The other two of his bullets miss.",

As long as your\nhit points are positive your character is not hindered in any way. If you\ngo below zero you have to roll to determine whether you stay conscious. The\ndifficulty for this task is:\n\n\n\nDC = \nhp\n\n\n\n\n\nagainst:\n\n\n\n1d10 = \nCON\n\n\n+ STR\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may add effort to this roll to stay awake.\n\n\nFor example, Jack got hit with a baseball bat over his head, and was dealt six\npoints of damage. He currently has two hit points remaining and would drop\nbelow zero, specifically to -4. His DC is thus 4.\n\n\nAnother example, John was stabbed with a knife and took 8 points of damage,\nhe was already barely standing at -1 HP. The DC to remain conscious is now 9\n(-1 -8 = -9).\n\n\nRecovering Hit Points\n\n\nIf all wounds are cared for, and you have time to rest and heal, you roll to\nsee if you naturally recover one hit point per week. Any strenuous activity -\nsuch as fighting or travelling - interferes with this natural healing ability,\nand no hit point is recovered in that week. To see if you can recover one hit\npoint make a constitution check against a DC totalling the amount of wounds you\nhave (see below for wounds).\n\n\nSomeone who is trained in \nMedicine\n can speed up this healing process.\nFirst roll to \ndiagnose\n the patient and then to \ntreat\n the wounds.\nThe DC is as followed:\n\n\n\nDC = \n \nhp\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nA character is who is trained in \nfirst aid\n can do the same, but the DC is\nis more difficult:\n\n\n\nDC = \nhp\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the diagnose check is successful any difference can be added to the treatment\nroll as a bonus. If the diagnose check was unsuccessful any difference is\nsubtracted from the treatment roll as a penalty.\n\n\nThen roll for treatment, with the same DC, and add or subtract any relevant\nbonus or penalty from the diagnose check. If you succeed you can heal one hit\npoint per day for one week. If you fail however, you do not cure any additional\nhit points. Diagnosis and treatment requires some sort medic laboratory,\nhospital, or at least a doctor\ns bag or a first aid kit. Diagnosis and treatment\ncan be done multiple times a day, as degreed by the GM.\n\n\nYou may treat yourself, but gain a +2 penalty on all checks while doing so.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe are aware that this healing rule is slow, difficult and cumbersome for\nthe player. Healing HP, and wounds for that matter, has been made a\nresponsibility of the campaign setting. See your relevant campaign setting\nmaterial for additional healing options, such as items or rules.\nSome settings might offer near instantaneous healing through items or\ntechnology, others might wish add to the survival game play experience by\nlimiting healing.\n\n\n\n\nWounds\n\n\nThe wounding system abstracts away injury, wounds and other impediments a\ncharacter gains through the loss of hit points. Having suffered \nfour wound\ndamage\n does not mean, that the character has four minor wounds. They might as\nwell be one major wound that has gradually gotten worse.\n\n\nWhenever a player takes damage (from any source) he has to roll to see whether\nhe sustains a wound. Wounds are separate from HP loss and represent negative\neffects a player might sustain for losing HP.\n\n\nTo see if the player gains a wound from roll a constitution/strength check\nagainst the the damage caused to the player: This is the damage after any\nrelevant armour is subtracted but \nbefore any zone modifiers are applied\n.\nMorale does apply to this roll, as do any other relevant bonuses gained from\ncertain perks or items. You \nmay not\n add effort to this roll.\n\n\n\n1d10 \n+ CON\n\n\n+ STR\n\n\n+ MOR\n\n\n+ MISC\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the check fails you gain the difference between the DC and your roll as\nwounds. These wounds reduces your maximum hit points by that amount until\ntreated. This effect stacks with all other wounds. Since your maximum hit\npoints are reduced, this means that your death threshold is also at your new\nnegative maximum hit points. If you reach zero maximum hit points because of\nwounds, you die.\n\n\nTreating Wounds\n\n\nTreating wounds works the same way as recovering hit points. You use \nMedicine\n\nor \nFirst Aid\n, diagnose first and add any relevant bonuses to the treatment\ncheck. The DC is determined by the amount of wound points sustained. For\n\nMedicine\n the amount of wound points is halved for the DC.\n\n\nSo for \nMedicine\n the check is:\n\n\n\nDC = \n\n \nwounds\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \nFirst Aid\n the check is more difficult:\n\n\n\nDC = \nwounds\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst you diagnose the wounds. If you fail the check you must add any difference\nto your next treatment roll as a penalty. If you succeed the check you can add\nthe difference to your treatment roll as a bonus.\n\n\nIf you succeed at the treatment roll, the patient recovers 1 wound. The patient\ndoes not regain any hit points, but his maximum hit points is raised by one.\nThis also possibly cures wounding effects, see down below for further\ninformation.\n\n\nWounds cannot be cured naturally over time, and either require specialised\nequipment or others to diagnose and treat you. A character can try to diagnose\nand treat himself, although he gains a +2 penalty to such checks. The DC is\nthus:\n\n\n\nDC = \nwounds\n\n\n+ 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor Wounds\n\n\nIf your maximum HP is reduced below one half of your normal HP through wounds\nyou have suffered a \nmajor wound\n. Whenever you do any strenuous activity on a\nday, you must roll a check against your half your wound total. If you fail\nthis check you gain another wound point.\n\n\nIf your maximum HP is reduced below one quarter of your normal HP through wounds\nyou have suffered a \nfatal wound\n. For every day your maximum hit points is\nreduced below one quarter, you must make another check against your wound total.\nIf you fail you gain another wound point.\n\n\nWounding Effects\n\n\nWhenever your wound points reach a multiple of five (5, 10, 15 etc.) you gain\none additional wounding effect. Roll ten sided dice against the table below to\ndetermine this adverse affect.\n\n\nIf your wound points are reduced below the nearest multiple of five, that\nnegative effect is cured.

It\nis up the game master to set this DC. A rule of thumb is that the range of this\npenalty should lie between +1 and +5, depending on illumination.\n\n\nCreatures with echolocation or scent abilities can still use these methods to\nmove about and act normally in complete darkness. Some creatures might even be\npossible to see normally in darkness or low light environments.\n\n\nFalling\n\n\nThe basic rule is: for every three metres a character falls he takes 1d6\npoints of damage.\n\n\nIf a character deliberately jumps the three metres, he may make an\n\nacrobatics\n check against the first set of damage, with a DC of 5 plus the\nmetres fallen, to avoid the 1d6 points of damage.\n\n\nShould the ground be soft or giving the threshold of when damage begins is\nincreased. Landing on soft pillow cushions, or a training mat will allow a\nperson to fall three or up to five metres higher without taking damage.\n\n\nThe same applies by falling into deep waters. If the water is deep enough, the\nplayer can jump into water from roughly twenty metres without taking damage.\nFor every five metres above that you still take 1d6 points of damage.\n\n\nFire Hazards\n\n\nFire hazards come in various shapes in sizes. The most common hazards though\ndo 1d6 points of fire damage. It is up to the game master and the situation\nto allow a player a dodge away from a fire hazard. For example if a small gas\nleak catches fire, and would otherwise harm the player, the game master might\nrule that the player can dodge out of the way of the fire stream.\n\n\nBeing completely engulfed in flames is different from being burned, and may\ncause additional fire damage. It is up the game master to add additional dices\nto such circumstances.\n\n\nA suits \nhazard\n rating may reduce the damage from fire hazards. The suit\nmay still catch fire though.\n\n\nIf the player catches on fire, he takes an additional 1d6 fire damage each\nround until the fire is put out. Taking out out the fire takes a dexterity\nor strength check against a fixed DC of 7.\n\n\nAnother player can help, either with some sort of fire blanket or fire\nextinguisher.\n\n\nAlso note that fire needs an oxygen environment to work, and the the most common\nway to remove fire hazards on ships is to vent the air in said room to space.\n\n\nRadiation Hazards\n\n\nRadiation is prevalent in space, on space walks say, certain planets or things\nthat require fuel are damaged. Damaged cores or damaged FTL drives may\nradiation depending on how much they are damaged.\n\n\nIt is up to the game master to define the radiation that is present in the\nbackground. The background radiation can be confined to a specific area, but\nshould always be a \nflat number\n. If a person or character is present in a\ncontaminated area, he takes this flat number as wound damage for every minute\nhe is in the area. The radiation damage thus reduces his maximum hit points.\nThis wounding damage does not incur any additional wounds.\n\n\nThe wounding damage, represents radiation sickness, and must be cured\nappropriately. A doctor can cure radiation poisoning just like any other wound,\nsee \nInjury and Death\n. Suits can protect against radiation, and provide flat\nresistance to radiation damage.\n\n\nLack of Air\n\n\nFor every minute a person is deprived of breathable air, he may make a check\nwith his constitution modifier to see if he starts suffocating. The DC\nstarts at 5 and increases by +2 for every additional minute. On the first failed\ncheck he starts to suffocate, and takes 1d6 damage each round.\n\n\nIf the player reaches zero hit points he automatically becomes unconscious, and\nif he reaches negative maximum hit points he dies.\n\n\nAs long as he has not reached negative maximum hit points, a person capable of\n\nfirst aid\n or \nmedicine\n can resuscitate him by supplying oxygen and by making\nan appropriate skill check against a DC of 8. If the check is successful the\ncharacter regains conscious and regains any suffocation damage over a course of\none minute.\n\n\nSmoke and fog\n\n\nSmoke obscures vision, and when inhaled might be poisonous. Depending on the\nsmoke or fog in question, vision might be limited and the game master gives out\npenalties on perception based skill checks.\n\n\nIf the smoke is deemed poisonous or unhealthy to the players, such as hot fumes\nfrom fires or toxic vapour from acids and other dangerous chemicals, he may ask\nthe players to roll a constitution check to avoid inhaling the fumes. The rules\nare the same as with drowning as the players are holding their breath.\n\n\nSuits with a closed breathing apparatus, or gas masks may make one immune to\nsuch fumes.\n\n\nIf the fume is inhaled the, fume may do additional damage to the player, such\nas radiation damage, acid damage or fire damage. Burning hot fumes, such as\nsteam may cause direct fire damage upon contact even if the player avoided\nbreathing it in. The same applies to clouds of acidic fumes and fogs.\n\n\nStarvation and Thirst\n\n\nCharacters might find themselves out of food and water, and without the means\nof obtaining them. In normal climates a person requires 2 litres of water per\nday, and in hot environments even up to four litres per day.\n\n\nA character can go without water for one day plus a number of hours equal to\nhis \nconstitution rank\n. For each additional hour afterwards without\nwater the character must make a constitution check against a DC of 5\nplus the numbers of hours passed, or take 1d6 points of damage.\n\n\nCharacters can go without food for three days, in growing discomfort. After that\ntime the character has to make constitution check against a DC of 5 plus one for\neach additional day or take 1d6 points of damage.\n\n\nStrong winds and storms\n\n\nStorms and strong winds impede the players movement, and the storm itself is\ntreated as \ndifficult terrain\n (see movement for details on that). It may also\nmake piloting or driving checks more difficult and impair vision. These should\nbe expressed as additional penalties to the DC of the respective skill checks.\nUsually ranging from between +1 for mild storms, and +5 for storms.\n\n\nMany storms may also carry other hazards with them. On many planets, storms\nbecome much more violent as those on Earth and may thus pose an additional\nthreat. A strong sand storm (above 500 kmh in wind speed) can cause injury to\nany unprotected person, as the sand is effectively sand blasting the persons\nskin. Strong wind currents may also carry radiation, toxic or acidic fumes\nwith them which also pose health risks to unprotected characters.",

Trying to convince\nsomeone else that your own viewpoint is right, is one example. A player can\nachieve this in many different ways: He can use deceit, intimidation or by\nsimply trying to talk and arguing the point.\n\n\nThe player decides what he wishes to do and the game master decides the DC. For\neach instance of interaction a separate roll is needed. If more than one roll\nis involved it is common that a few among them might fail.

Or an already scared and tortured captive might be more\nsusceptible to further intimidation attempts and thus receives a penalty on\nhis check. The game master should define this bonus or penalty depending on the\nsituation. These penalties or bonuses should range between \nminus five\n\n(-5) and \nplus five\n(+5) depending on how believable the lie or intimidation is.\n\n\nMorale\n\n\nThe main drive of every person is motivation and morale. People who are\nmotivated might go the extra mile to achieve something, or if morale is low\nmight even abandon their current task or goal. Likewise a threat of impending\ndanger or even death can cause men to achieve the seemingly impossible.\n\n\nThe game represents morale and motivation as a single game statistic for each\ncharacter that is added to all roles the players make. It can be negative\n(representing loss of morale or motivation), zero (no strong feelings one way\nor the other) or positive (motivation to succeed). The morale bonus is\ncontrolled by the game master and can be determined from many\ndifferent sources.\n\n\nValues range between \nminus three\n (-3) and \nplus three\n (+3),\nwith minus three being despair to the point of abandoning one\ns own believes or\nprinciples, and plus three being an almost religious frenzy to achieve the\ngoal, even if it can result in personal harm. The morale bonus has nothing to\ndo with personal feelings (like fear or anger) although they might stem from\nthem.\n\n\nA soldier who has abandoned all hope of returning alive (say a -1 morale\nbonus) from this deployment might still charge headlong into battle. Another\nexample is a crew that has just realised they are stranded in deep space\nwith no hope for rescue and resources left for just a few hours. The\ngame master decrees that a -3 penalty is appropriate for the situation. After\nrepairing the emergency distress signal they are contacted by a rescue party\nand the game master decides that the morale has been restored and is now at +1.\n\n\nAffecting Morale\n\n\nTragic events, such as the death or serious injury of a friend or comrade can\nleave morale permanently reduced or lowered.

A battle where the other side is\nalready retreating and very few casualties have been sustained, can also be\na great boost for morale.\n\n\nIt is always up to the game master to determine the morale of the group or\nenemies. A game master may also forgo to use the morale system at all in his\ncampaign.\n\n\nInfluencing Morale\n\n\nMorale can be influenced by successful or failed social checks. For example\na successful Oratory check can increase or restore morale. The skill check for\nOratory is made against \nfive\n plus the morale bonus or the positive\npenalty, adding any circumstance penalties as the game master sees fit. Such a\nspeech can made in front of a group of people or towards an individual in\nparticular.

The game master the DM sets the morale for everyone to -3, except\nfor the captain who he set to -1 since this has already happened to him\nbefore.  The captain has already formulated a plan. She addresses a speech at\nhis crew detailing the plan and trying to boost morale.

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nThis section describes how vessels in Endless Horizons functions. Vessels\nincorporate everything the players together can control and range from cars,\nhelicopters, tanks all the way up to big capital space vessels.\n\n\nOperating Vessels\n\n\nIf the vessel is a land craft (such as a car, tank or motorcycle) the skill\n\nDriving\n is used. For space craft the skill \nPilot Spacecraft\n is used instead.\nShould two pilots or drivers enter in a competition against each other, those\nskills are pitched against each other. Those skills also replace \nDodge\n to\navoid obstacles.\n\n\nIn many cases the skill \nMechanics\n can be used to make repairs to those\nvehicles. Should the vehicle have mounted guns they are operated using the\n\nHeavy Weapons\n skill. This includes vehicle mounted heavy machine guns, or\nfiring the canon (or rifle) of a tank.\n\n\nGravity\n\n\nThere is no artificial gravity in Endless Horizons, except on large space\nstations. On these massive space station the \nartificial gravity\n is generated\nby using rotary forces. Ships, and other space vessels that do not provide\ngravity are usually navigated by using magnetic boots. All walls, floors and\nceiling of these stations can be walked upon using magnetic boots. These boots\ncan also be used to walk on the outer hull of vessels. All space suits provide\nmagnetic boots and day to day clothing issues on vessels includes normal boots\nthat can be used to walk on magnetic surfaces.\n\n\nThe magnetic boots can be turned off to navigate the micro gravity using the\nskill \nMicro Gravity\n.\n\n\nWalking and running with magnetic boots is treated as regular movement on a\nplanet of 1 earth g, for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\nAtmosphere\n\n\nAlmost all vessels come with a life support system that provides breathable air\non the ship. This allows people to life and work on those ships without the need\nof a space suit. The atmosphere on such ships can be lost however. Damage to the\nhull can cause the atmosphere to vent into space. Also, a damaged life support\ncan stop filtering the used air and slowly cause the air on a vessel to become\ntoxic to human life.\n\n\nVessel Statistics\n\n\nHit Points\n\n\nVessels, just as characters, have hit points. If the hit points reach zero the\nvessel is considered \ndisabled\n. This means it will no longer properly operate\nand usually all power to its systems are cut. If the vessel reaches its negative\nhit points it is complete destroyed, usually killing all crew on board with it.\n\n\nArmour\n\n\nEach vessel may optionally have armour. This armour will always reduce incoming\ndamage by that amount. Unlike armour of characters, it will never be depleted.\n\n\nEven the smallest Vehicle armour can stop all small arms fire, except from very\nhigh calibres such as the .50 BMG, the 12.7x108 or above. Anti vehicle weapons\nare also highly effective against vehicles with armour, such as RPGs or special\nhigh calibre anti material rifles.\n\n\nShield\n\n\nSome vehicles come with a shield. This shield gives a given amount of points,\nwhich in case of incoming damage, is always reduced first. Once the shield is\nat zero, any incoming damage is done normally to the vessel.\n\n\nInstalled Modules\n\n\nEach vessel might optionally have module slots. These module slots can be used\nto add additional capabilities to the vessel, such as FTL drives, weapons or\nshields. It always depends on the vessel how many module slots exist, and\nwhether they can be exchanged and upgraded.\n\n\nCrew and Passengers\n\n\nVessels may require a certain amount of crew to be present to operate the\nvehicle efficiently. Such as modern tanks may require a driver, a gunner and\na commander to operate and maximum efficiency. If a certain amount of crew is\nrequired to operate the vehicle, it is listed in the description of the vehicle.\n\n\nPassengers are always optional, but many vehicles allow you to bring additional\npersonnel along for the ride.\n\n\nRooms\n\n\nBigger vessels may be fitted with additional rooms. See the chapter Rooms for\nadditional information.\n\n\nDocking bays\n\n\nLarger vessels, medium and above, also sometimes come with a docking bays.\nDocking bays house smaller vessels (usually just small vessels). See the ship\ndetails on how many small vessels the ship is capable of housing and operating.\nA docking bay also often comes with all necessary equipment to maintain the\nsmaller vessel, such as repair and refuiling stations.\n\n\nDocking bays sometimes count as rooms. If that is the case, the ship does not\ncome with docking bays per default; but a room has been refitted to fit a small\nvessel.\n\n\nCargo Bays\n\n\nCargo bays do just what they say on the tin: Carry and hold cargo. It is\nspecified in the ship\ns detailed list on how much cargo the ship is capable of\ncarrying.\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nThe speed factor describes how nimble the aircraft is. For most small vessels\nthis value is positive, giving the pilot a bonus in dog fights and while evading\nenemy fire. Bigger vessels might even have a negative value, representing their\nhuge mass and slow and sluggish manoeuvring capabilities.\n\n\nIf the speed is not given, this means that the vessel is stationary, either\nbecause the drives have failed, or because the vessel is a station.\n\n\nType\n\n\nAll vessels are given one more types, defining in which environments they\noperate in. \nSpace\n means that the vehicle is capable of manoeuvring in outer\nspace, \nair\n means that is also capable of flying through an atmosphere. If a\nvehicle has both \nspace\n and \nair\n listed, the vehicle is capable of making a\ntransition from atmosphere to outer space and vice versa. \nLand\n means that\nthe vehicle moves on land, and \nwater\n means that it moves on or in water.\n\n\nAn amphibious troop transporter might have \nland\n and \nwater\n as it\ns types,\nand a huge capital vessel might only have \nspace\n as it is not capable of\nentering an atmosphere.\n\n\n Air\n\n\n Space\n\n\n Land\n\n\n Water\n\n\nVessel Size\n\n\nThe vessels are split into different size categories. Modules from one size\ncategory are not interchangeable from one size category to another.\n\n\nSmall Vessels\n\n\nSmall Vessels usually crew around five to ten people. They are the most common\ntypes of vessels, and incorporate things like cars, helicopters, tanks,\ntransporters and space attack fighters, bombers and other small aircraft.\n\n\nSmall Spacecraft and other small vessels are special in that vessels of higher\nsize types can usually carry small vessels around with them.\n\n\nMedium Vessels\n\n\nMedium vessels usually have a crew of around 10 to 50 people. Most of the medium\nvessels are either space craft, or large water vessels such as submarines or\ndestroyers. Some medium vessels may even be able to carry a small vessel. Such\nas a larger destroyer or frigate may have small landing vessels or attack craft\nstored.\n\n\nLarge Vessels\n\n\nLarge vessels carry around 50 to a 100 crew, and most commonly large space\ndestroyers, huge cruise liners or massive tanking and trading vessels. They\noften come with a fleet of small vessels, to be used as a transfer vessels,\nlanding vessels or transport and attack craft.\n\n\nCapital Vessels\n\n\nCapital vessels are huge and massive spacecraft and ships that usually hold more\nthan 150 in crew. They are the backbone of most modern attack fleets and\nfearsome in combat. Capital vessels usually hold a massive amount of small\nvessels as attack fighters, bombers and transport ships and are usually\naccompanied by large vessels and even medium vessels to give them fire support.\n\n\nOnly the biggest armies, largest companies and richest colonies can afford to\nbuild and operate capital vessels. They come with a wide variety of weapons and\ntheir presence alone is often enough to scare enemies into submission.\n\n\nA special kind of capital vessel that is not used for combat is the colony ship.\nIt houses everything required to send people to a new planet for terraforming\nand colonisation.",

See\nthe chapter on \nVehicle Equipment\n for tables and lists of specific modules.\n\n\nSublight Engines\n\n\nSublight engines are used to manoeuvre the vessel by simply accelerating it\nto some speed below the speed of light. If a vessel has the type \nspace\n the\nengines can also be used to move the vessel in space. Engines that operate\nin space do not automatically mean they also operate in an atmosphere.\n\n\nFor a driven vehicle the \nsublight engines\n are simply the motors, engines and\ngear boxes required for the vehicle to operate.\n\n\nLife Support Systems\n\n\nLife support systems are responsible for producing everything that is required\nto keep the crew alive. They range from oxygen, water and waste recyclers, to\ncrew quarters, and food processors. Any stasis chambers (such as cryo-chambers)\nare also part of the life support systems.\n\n\nPower Cores\n\n\nPower cores, or reactors are responsible for giving the vehicle enough power\nto operate systems and other modules. They range from small car batteries, up\nto large reactors on large capital vessels. Without them the vehicle usually\ndoes not operate, and they thus considered a critical part of the vessel.\n\n\nShield Generators\n\n\nShield generates are responsible for generating a protective shield around the\nvessel to soak up incoming damage. A shield generator has a power requirement,\nusually a special type of power generator that is required to operate the\nshield. The shield points define how much damage the shield will soak up before\nit collapses, and the recharge rate determines how much shield is regenerated\nper round.\n\n\nSensor array\n\n\nThe sensor array provides communications, sub light sensors (such as radar) and\nother means of communications such as SOS beacons. It can also be used to scan\nfor other ships, planet or distress beacons and is needed to plot course for FTL\ndrives.\n\n\nHull\n\n\nThe hull is the name for the various parts of the ship that covers things such\nas rooms, or other modules. It is no specific part, but just keeps the ship\ntogether in one piece.\n\n\nBridge or Cockpit\n\n\nThe bridge in larger vessels, or cockpit in smaller ones, houses all the\ncontrols required for the pilot (or pilots) to operate and fly the vehicle.\nOn spaceships it is often hidden somewhere inside with the pilot being provided\nvisual link and feed to see where he or she is going. On land and air vehicles\nit is often directly accessible from the outside.\n\n\nWeapons\n\n\nWeapons are usually directly mounted onto the vessel. They are either controlled\nby the pilot directly, by a gunner or on larger vessels by an AI. To aim and\nfire vessel weapons the skill \nHeavy Weapons\n is used.\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of weapons available for vessels:\n\n\n\n\nDumb fire rockets\n: Rockets that just fly straight. The skill \nHeavy Weapons\n\nis used to fire and hit with these rockets.\n\n\nMissiles\n: Rockets and missiles that have some sort of targeting system. They\nhave their own \npiloting\n and \nspeed\n skills that determines if they hit their\ntarget or not.\n\n\nRail guns\n: Large batteries that accelerate mass using a magnetic field. They\nare the most common type of weapons for ship to ship combat.\n\n\nPoint Defence\n: Often multiple batteries of Gatling guns that are used to\nfire at missiles, or ships at very close ranges.\n\n\nCanons\n: Large canons that fire huge projectiles, such as the canons on\ntanks, and anti-infantry vehicles.\n\n\n\n\nAll of these weapons require ammunition and power to operate. See the detailed\nlist and tables of \nVessel Equipment\n for available weapons.\n\n\nFTL Drives\n\n\nFTL drives allow the vessel to go faster than light in various ways. There are\nmultiple drives available, each with their own benefits and disadvantages.\nUsing a jump drive creates a radioactive isotope. The radioactivity is not\nharmful to humans, but it can be very easily picked up by modern radars.\nAnalysis of the radioactive residue allows an approximation about when a vessel\nactivated its jump drive and how big the vessel was.\n\n\nHyperspace\n\n\nThe hyper drive utilizes the subspace to allow interstellar travel. A vessel\nusing a hyper drive can go to destination in a straight line, because there\nare no obstacles in the subspace.\n\n\nWarp\n\n\nThe warp drive is the most common FTL drive, albeit it\ns much slower than it\ns\ncounterparts. It utilizes a subspace bubble that\ns created around a vessel,\ncontracting the space in front of it and expanding space behind it.\n\n\nEvery vessel has to have its own warp drive. It is not possible to create a\nwarp bubble for another vessel. Activating the warp drive happens almost\ninstantly, but it takes some time for the ship to pick up FTL speeds. This\nwind-up time gets longer the bigger the vessel is and never reaches the\neffectiveness of other drive types.\n\n\nWhile this drive allows for FTL travel, obstacles such as planets, stars, etc.\nstill persist and have to be avoided or else the vessel would crash into them.\n\n\nWormhole\n\n\nThe wormhole drive is fastest among the FTL drives, and allows near instant\ntransportation between two points. It however does not fit onto small vessels.\nOpening and maintaining a stable wormhole requires huge amounts of power.\n\n\nOnce the wormhole is opened the travel only goes one way (from the point the\nhole has been opened). As long as the wormhole is open ships can fly through it,\nalthough once the ship has flown through that has opened the wormhole, it\ncollapses.\n\n\nThings that do not actively steer through the wormhole will exit it at a random\npoint in space and are considered lost in space.\n\n\nOpening a wormhole near an object with a huge amount of mass (such as a planet,\nsun, or moon) is not possible.\n\n\nMany large colonies usually operate a wormhole station that can be used, for a\nfee, to fly to other large colonies nearly instantly.",

Range has no impact on the difficulty of\nthe checks involved.\n\n\nTargeting\n\n\nA pilot has to compete with another pilot using the respective piloting skill\nand speed of the craft they are using.  The enemy rolls a piloting check and\nadds his speed to determine the DC:\n\n\n\nDC = 1d10 =\n\n6\n\n\n+ 2\n\n\n+ 4\n\n= 12\n\n\n\n\nThis is the DC the attacker has to beat with his piloting check.\n\n\n\n1d10 =\n\n4\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n+ 4\n\n\n+ 5\n\n= 14\n\n\n\n\nThe attacker would normally not be able to hit his target, but the player used\neffort to make the shot happen.  At this point, the attacker can either fire\none of his weapons and hit the enemy, or lock on the target for his guided\nmissile system, if any.\n\n\nFor turrets on larger ships, or weapon batteries, instead of using the\npiloting skill you use the according weapon skill instead, namely heavy\nweapons.\n\n\nLong Distance Fights\n\n\nIn space distances can be very vast between vessel. The difficulty to hit\nanother vessel over longer distances is defined by the overall distance and\nthe speed of the vessel. Vessels that are outside of the effective range of a\nweapon can\nt be hit with this specific weapon, as the travel time of the\nprojectile would require to much time, making it very easy for the other\nvessel to dodge the oncoming threat. The attacker uses his heavy weapons skill\nfor attacking an enemy. If the attacker is the pilot (for example of a one-man\nfighter craft), he can use either the heavy weapons skill or the piloting\nskill, which ever is higher.\n\n\n\nDC =\n\n5\n\n\n+ 6\n\n\n- 2\n\n\n+ 3\n\n= 12\n\n\n\n\nThe attacker rolls:\n\n\n\n1d10 =\n\n7\n\n\n+ 3\n\n= 10\n\n\n\n\nThe attacker would miss his target, because of the high distance involved.\n\n\nIf the attacker hits, he has now two options: Dodge the attack, or in some\ncases use defensive measures (such as point defence) to negate the attack.\n\n\nPoint Defence\n\n\nThe point defence of a ship can be used to destroy small vessels or missiles\nthat are too close. At these distances, range has no impact on the hit\ndifficulty anymore. A fighter pilot may use his piloting skill to dodge the\npoint defence. To destroy an incoming missile the pilot must hit the missile,\nby hitting an attack with the point defence against the missiles attack. If\nthe pilot succeeds the missile is destroyed.\n\n\nDodging in space\n\n\nTo dodge an attack or targeting missle in space, the pilot pits his piloting\nskill and the speed of his vessel against the attack. Just like normal \nmelee\ncombat\n me may use his reaction to dodge, without incurring a penalty. If he\nis out of actions for this turn, the pilot can still dodge but incurs a\ncumulative -2 penalty for each additional dodge attempt.\n\n\nMissiles\n\n\nTracking missiles are treated as pilots, as their targeting AI is used to\nsteer the missle to its target. To dodge a missile, a pilot pits his piloting\nskill and his vessel\ns speed, against the missile\ns speed and piloting skill.\n\n\nMost missiles, if evaded, will make a u-turn and attack one more in the next\ncombat round. Unless otherwise specified, the missile is considered out of\nfuel after its second attack has failed again.\n\n\nDealing Damage\n\n\nAfter determining if you hit your target, you can deal damage to the enemy.\nIf the enemy has shields, the shield value is lowered by the damage dealt. If\nthe damage does not exceed the shields value, you do not have to roll which\nmodule is hit. Also, if the enemies armour value is greater than the damage\nyou would deal, no damage is dealt instead. Additionally, weapons that can\nt\npenetrate a certain armour type won\nt deal any damage either.\nIf, after shields and armour, there is still damage left, roll the appropriate\ndice to determine the location where you have hit the vessel. See the list of vessels,\nfor details on what dice to roll and for a look up table on where you have\nhit the vessel.\n\n\nDamage for modules is tracked separately from the vessel. While lowering a\nvessel to 0 HP disables it or destroys it at negative maximum HP, the same\nmay apply to modules. See the list below on what happens if you damage a\nspecific module.\n\n\nYou can also try to attack a specific sub module of a ship, instead of rolling\nfor the location on the vessel\ns table. This implies a penalty that\ns\ndependent on the modules size.  The left outer column is specifies the attack,\nwhile the top row specifies the target.  F.e., if a small vessel were to\nattack a capital vessel, it would impose a -4 on the DC.  On the other hand, a\nlarge vessel attacking a small vessel would raise the DC by +6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsmall\n\n\nmedium\n\n\nlarge\n\n\ncapital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsmall\n\n\n+2\n\n\n0\n\n\n-2\n\n\n-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedium\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+2\n\n\n0\n\n\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlarge\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncapital\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDealing Damage to Submodules\n\n\nSublight Engines\n\n\nIf the sublight engines are below half of their hit points, their speed output\nis halved. This is their base speed output that is halved, before any other\nbonuses or penalties from submodules are added.\n\n\nOnce the sublight engines reach zero hit points, their effective speed output\nis zero. This also happens if the sublight engines do not receive power from\nthe core.\n\n\nIf the sublight engines reach minus their maximum hit points, they explode and\ncan no longer be repaired. The explosion deals additional damage to the hull of\nthe ship, depending on the vessels size:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nDamage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Support Systems\n\n\nIf the life support systems reach zero hit points, they no longer produce fresh\nair. The ship\ns remaining air supply will roughly last for a few more hours (up\nto the game master\ns discretion). This also happens if the life support systems\nare completely destroyed, or are out of power.\n\n\nPower Core\n\n\nShould the power core reach zero hit points it is disabled and no longer\nproduces any power. All other modules are effectively disabled.\n\n\nIf the power core is destroyed a massive explosion shakes the vessel. The\nvessel\ns hull takes the following damage, depending on its size:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nDamage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n\n\n250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShield Generators\n\n\nIf the shield generator gets below half its hit points, the maximum shield\noutput is also halved. Should the shield generator reach zero hit points, it is\nconsidered disabled. A disabled shield generator no longer produces a shield,\nand will not recharge until it is repaired.\n\n\nIf the shield generator is destroyed (it drops below its negative maximum hit\npoints) the hull takes the following damage:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nDamage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensor array\n\n\nIf the sensor array drops below zero hit points all communications are lost,\nexcept for emergency broadcasting. The sensor array will only stop working\ncompletely if it reaches its negative maximum hit points.\n\n\nCockpit or Bridge\n\n\nOnce the cockpit reaches zero hit points its protection for the crew is lost.\nAny additional damage that then is caused to the cockpit is directly transfered\nto all the crew within the cockpit or bridge.\n\n\nIf the cockpit or bridge is destroyed, the vessel can no longer be operated.\n\n\nWeapons\n\n\nIf weapons drop to or below zero hit points they can no longer be operated or\nfired. If they drop below their negative maximum hit points, they are completely\ndestroyed.\n\n\nFTL\n\n\nIf the FTL drops to or below zero hit points it can no longer be operated. If it\nreaches negative maximum hit points they are two outcomes: If the FTL is\ncurrently charging the hull takes damage as noted below; if the FTL is idle,\nnothing happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nDamage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCargo Bay \n Docking Bay\n\n\nThe hull is damaged instead, but the game master can decide what cargo is\njetisoned from the cargo bay.

Security systems usually\ncannot be hacked or attacked from afar, but prevent the vessel from theft and\nother illegal access while docked or parked.\n\n\nAll security systems provide a DC against which \nHacking\n and \nIntrusion\n skill\nchecks must be made against. If a crew member wishes to detect or even reverse a\nhack or intrusion attempt he must pitch his \nHacking\n or \nIntrusion\n against\nthat of the intruder. The person on the defending side may gains a bonus from\nthe security module, as listed below.\n\n\nSecurity Systems do not come with in sizes, but are the same for all vessel\nsizes, except for the price. The table below lists the prices for each vessel\nsize (small, medium, large and capital) and the DC for intrusion and hacking\nattempts, as the system provides him with tools and countermeasures against\nintruders.\n\n\nHaving no security system does not automatically mean that the vehicle can be\noperated without any sort of clearance.

If it is capable of burst firing it is noted in the special column.\n\n\nRailguns\n are used for long range sniping, and are the main weapons most ships\nuse for ship to ship combat. \nPoint defence\n or PD are used in close quarters,\nand represent machine guns, Gatling guns and other weapons with a high rate of\nfire. They are mainly effective at closer rangers, against soft targets and\nfor destroying missiles. \nMissile launchers\n are used destroy armoured targets\nand are highly effective against vehicles, but their ammunition is expensive\nand limited. The stats for range, damage and speed for the missiles are listed\nin the rockets and missiles section. Launcher\ns fire one rocket and then reload,\nwhile missile batteries are preloaded with a fixed amount of rockets.

            "text": "Firearms\n\n\nThis section lists all available firearms. Each firearm uses a magazine to feed\n(be it internally or externally detachable) and fires some sort of cartridge.\nDifferent firearms use different calibres, and for each calibre different\nammunition is available. Most of the time these are normal, hollow point (for\nincreased effectiveness non-armoured targets) and armour piercing (for more\ndamage against armour.\n\n\nIf a firearm is not listed in the section and your players wishes to use it,\njust add them. This list is not exhaustive for the massive amounts of available\nfirearms in the world today.\n\n\nMagazines\n\n\nMany modern firearms (especially handguns, rifles) come with detachable box\nmagazines. These are most commonly not interchangeable between firearms unless\nexplicitly noted. Many firearms also come with internal magazines, for example\nmany pump action shotguns come with an internal magazine. Another good example\nare revolvers.\n\n\nMagazines are cheap to come by, and usually cost a tenth of the firearm they\nbelong to.\n\n\nIt is up to the player to manage, reload and maintain his magazines. It is not\npossible to reload a magazine during combat but if spare bullets are available\nmagazines can be reloaded during downtime (travel with a shuttle etc.).\n\n\nFiring Modes\n\n\nMost fire arms are single action (meaning one trigger pull fires one bullet).\nBut many also come with burst (one trigger pull fires multiple bullets) or\neven fully automatic. The modes that are available depends on the firearm or\neven sometimes on the model of a specific firearm.\n\n\nThe table lists modes with abbreviations. \nS\n stands for single shot,\n\nB\n stands for burst (three round burst unless otherwise noted), \nA\n\nstands for automatic, and \nR\n stands for repeating, meaning that a\nmechanism has to be operated to cycle the next round into the chamber.\n\n\nCartridges\n\n\nEach firearm fires a certain calibre. The bullet defines the damage that is\ndone, while the firearm describes additional characteristics such as effective\nrange, fire-modes and more. Many cartridges come in different variations, such\nas normal, sub sonic, tracer; and may come with different bullets (hollow\npoint, armour penetrating steel tip). Down below is a list of cartridges that\nare currently available in \nEndless Horizons\n.\n\n\nEach bullet deals piercing and bludgeoning damage to a target. The piercing\ndamage represents the wound canal, and the bludgeoning damage represents the\nkinetic energy transfer to internal organs and tissue.\n\n\nThe cost and weight is for the given amounts of

Slots are used to wear equipment directly on the body\nfor easy access. Slots could be pockets on trousers or jackets, or holsters that\nare carried on a belt.\n\n\nThere are three types of slots:\n\n\n\n\nArmour slots\n: They provide a possibility to insert protective plating\n(see below for list of available armour plates).\n\n\nFast access slots\n or \nFA slots\n are slots that are meant to be\naccessed quickly by the wearer. Pouches on a chest carrier or holsters usually\ncome with a few \nFA slots\n to allow for fast access to guns, ammunition\nor other useful items. Accessing a \nFA slot\n takes a swift action.\n\n\nMisc. slots\n are slots that can store equipment but are not as easily\naccessed as \nFA slots\n. Accessing them takes a normal action. Examples\nfor \nmisc. slots\n are pockets on trousers or jackets.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing other items (for example in a bag or backpack) usually takes two\nactions or longer.\n\n\nClothing\n\n\nNormal clothing is usually not listed in this chapter. It is deemed as\ntoo unimportant to list prices or weight. They are readily available\nin most stores for little money (ranging from two to ten credits).\n\n\nHowever, both pants and jackets provide misc slots. Pants are considered to\nprovide 2 \nmisc. slots\n, and jackets usually also provide 2 \nmisc. slots\n.\n\n\nA special case are leather holsters or belts, which provide one 1 \nfast access\nslot\n and 2 \nmisc. slots\n.\n\n\nBody Armour\n\n\nBody armour comes in many different shapes and sizes. The most common are metal\nplates that are inserted into what is called a \nchest carrier\n. These plates\nthen stop the bullets from entering and absorb some of the force of the bullet.\nThe armour usually covers the most vital part of body (i.e. the chest and back)\nand come with a specific rating. If a specified calibre is stopped by the\narmour the target takes only half the bludgeoning damage instead. The rest of\nthe damage is absorbed by the armour. Yet if the armour reaches zero hit points\nit stops being effective. If the bullet is not stopped by armour, both the\narmour and person being hit take equal amounts of damage.\n\n\nArmour is classified into various \ntiers\n determining what kinds of threats\nit stops. Please see the calibres to see what kind of armour tier a specific\ncalibre penetrates. All armour is capable of defending a player from slashing\ndamage from knives and other small blades or thrown weapons.\n\n\nAll plates require a carrier. The kevlar vest has protection for both front\nand back (both for 40 hit points) and cannot be worn in combination with a\nchest carrier, except for the FREJ MK I tactical vest (see below). You also\ncannot carry more than one tactical vest, plate carrier or kevlar armour on\nthe torso at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmour\n\n\nClass\n\n\nHP\n\n\nCost\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevlar Vest\n\n\nI\n\n\n20\n\n\n100\n\n\n2.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class I\n\n\nI\n\n\n30\n\n\n100\n\n\n1.5kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class II\n\n\nII\n\n\n40\n\n\n150\n\n\n2.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class III\n\n\nIII\n\n\n50\n\n\n250\n\n\n3.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class IV\n\n\nIV\n\n\n60\n\n\n350\n\n\n3.5kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class V\n\n\nV\n\n\n70\n\n\n450\n\n\n3.8kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class VI\n\n\nVI\n\n\n80\n\n\n550\n\n\n4.3kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChest Carries\n\n\nThe most commonly used armour is a plate and chest carrier with armour plates\ninserted.

            "text": "NPCs\n\n\nThis section of the rules provides some pre-generated NPCs and enemies.\n\n\nReading the entries\n\n\nAll secondary abilities, such as hit points, are already calculated and the\nskill modifiers include any relevant bonuses from primary abilities. Most of\nthe entries suggest basic equipment, which of course can (and should be)\ncustomised for the specific role. A Russian Spetsnaz operative (Expert\nSoldier) might for example use an AK based rifle instead of an AR-15 based\nrifle.\n\n\nMost of the NPCs entries, are separated into four tiers, depending on their\nskill and effectiveness: \nRookie\n, \nExperienced\n, \nExpert\n and \nVeteran\n.\n\n\nTiers\n\n\nThe tiers reflect how strong a certain NPC is, and also how skilled he is in\nhis field. For most intelligent NPCs this also reflects a sense of experience\nand advanced skill and training. Non intelligent NPCs, such as animals, are\noften not graded in those tiers, unless it makes sense for the specific NPCs.\nFor example combat drones might be graded in these tiers, with a higher rank\nreflecting more advanced armament, targeting A.I. or armour.\n\n\nRookie\n\n\nRookies may have just finished their training or are otherwise inexperienced\nin whatever they are doing. A soldier straight out of basic training is\nconsidered a \nRookie Soldier\n, or a medical doctor that just graduated and\nhas gained his or her Ph.D.\n\n\nExperienced\n\n\nExperienced NPCs separate themselves from Rookie\ns in that they have at least\na few years of active experience in their field. A medical doctor that has\ncompleted his or her foundation years and has been working in a hospital should\nbe considered an \nExperienced Doctor\n. An experienced soldier has seen combat\ndeployment, and an experienced pilot has hundreds - if not thousands - of hours\nof flight.\n\n\nExpert\n\n\nExpert NPCs are highly trained, or specialised to a degree that distinguishes\nthem from others in their field who have just gained operational experiences.\nPolice officers that have excessive training in anti-terror operations,\nspecialised surgeons or scientists on the fore-front of their field are\nconsidered Expert NPCs.\n\n\nVeteran\n\n\nVeteran NPCs are the best of the best.
