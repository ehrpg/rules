# Endless Horizons

Endless Horizons is a pen & paper game set in a futuristic space setting. Here
you will find the overview of the rules.

# Scope

The Endless Horizons system gives you the basic framework that is required to
create a science fiction based pen and paper game. The rules are built to be
easy to use, and can be extended and changed to your individual needs.

Endless Horizons does not bring a default setting, and as such does not define
races (except humans), factions, places or history. But to provide a basic
common denominator, the following things are provided:

- Modern fire arms and rules to use them.
- Some vessels, small and large for space combat.
- Rules for social interactions, including a more system.
- Various skills and backgrounds.

# Flexible

The system itself is very flexible. For example to simply play a modern day
pen and paper system, just remove the space vessels and keep the firearms and
melee combat.

If you want a more low science fiction setting, just remove shield
generators and FTL drives. This makes space combat more deadly, but also adds
a gritty and survival horror atmosphere to space combat.
