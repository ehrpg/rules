The T-150 is one of the most modern and deadly assualt tanks available.
It can be operated by a crew of two, or by an AI. It uses four legs to walk and
navigate difficult terrain, and the main turrent has two guns: a large cannon
and a Gatling gun that fires .50 BMG or 12.7x108. One person acts as the driver
while the other acts as the commander and gunner. Through its hydraulic legs it
is capable of small jumps (up to three five metres wide, and three metres high).

It is heavily armored, but rather slow and sluggish. It's only weakness is a
small crew hatch beneath the main turrent.  It comes with a standard encrypted
military grade radio array, infra red and night vision modules to aid the
gunner.

The Mil Mi-72 is the newest and most modern in a line of high quality transport
helicopters. It carries a crew of two, a pilot and co-pilot, and can carry up to
ten passengers, and/or a cargo of 30 metric tons. If the helicopter cargo area
is used to transport the cargo, no crew space is available. But the helicopter
is also capable of transporting 30 tons via air lift, and ten passengers at the
same time.

While it comes with armour, it does not - by default - come with weapons.
Although a military version exists (the Mil Mi-72T) that does come with two
mounted heavy machine guns on each side.
