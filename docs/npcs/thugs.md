# Thugs

This page offers pre-built thugs, criminals and other shady characters.
A thug might be a common thief, street soldier of a criminal gang or just
a bouncer at a night club. Their tier might be representative within a
hierarchy of an organised crime syndicate, with low level soldiers being
rookies or experienced, while capos are expert thugs, and a crime boss might
even be a veteran thug.

## Rookie Thug
