The Baleen RP-2 is, after the RP-1, one of the oldest general purpose vessels.
Even after decades, its ruggedness, versatility, substantial reliability even
in harsh conditions and low production costs makes it a popular choice among
pioneers of the final frontier.

It is widely used in civilian areas as transport, hauler or trading vessel. It
was once used widely by many air forces, corporations and bigger organisations
and is now being replaced by more modern contemporaries. This lead the civilian
market to being flooded with surplus RP-2's.

It can house up to five rooms, and/or a bay for one small vessel. The wide
spread use of the RP-2 stems from it's flexibility to fill about any required
role. The RP-2 is considered the jack-of-all-trades of space.

Most versions of the RP-2 do not come with weapons, as a point defence is not
needed because of the shields.

The bridge of the RP-2 seats five people: a pilot, a co-pilot, a navigation,
a communication officer and an operator for the sensor array. Additional seats
for crew are available behind the cockpit. Additional stations are spread across
the ship from which the vital systems (engines, hull integrity, life support and
so forth) can be overview and operated.

The RP-2 has four docking hatches, two on the front and two on the rear of the
ship. One big cargo hatch allows the loading and unloading of cargo in the rear
of the ship.
