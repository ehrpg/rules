# Rooms

Bigger vessels may even offer specific rooms, such as crew quarters, medical
rooms, engineering quarters or docking bays for other vessels. Since ships are
built by large shipyards most ships of one specific type come with the same
layout. Specific layouts are possible, but usually cost extra.

The ship will list how many rooms are available for fitting, and will also list
a default configuration.

## Crew quarters

Crew quarters are comprised of living quarters, bunks and sanitary installations
necessary to house crew and passengers. Depending on the quality and the size of
the ship, crew quarters can house from one to twenty people.

The captain's quarters are special kind of crew quarters. They generally only
house few people (from one to three) and are bigger and more luxurious.

Lack of crew quarters, or an overcrowded ship is usually not a big concern for
small trips. On longer trips, or even as a semi-permanent state of living it
will affect morale of the crew.

## Medical Bay

A medic bay as all hardware available to treat patients. It comes fully equipped
with various supplies of first aid, medicine and operating utensils. Complex
operations or treatments cannot be performed on a medical bay, and require a
_medic station_ instead, which is the larger version of the medical bay. A
typical medical bay can house up to two or three patients, while a medic station
can house up to several dozens.

The medical bay lowers the DC of _medicine_ and _first aid_ checks by 1, and
the medical station lowers the DC of _medicine_ checks by 3, and the DC of
_first aid_ checks by 1.

## Utility Bay

A utility bay can be used for almost anything the crew want to: for storage, as
a small engineering bay or as emergency crew quarters.

Utility bays are also often used as weapon lockers or makeshift prisons.

## Engineer Bay

All ships have some sort of engineering bay or station. This station has most
of the important modules (live support, power core and FTL drives) in one
location. This allows for easier maintenance and repairs to said modules.
Whether the engineer bay is an actual room, depends on the vessel size. Small
vessels tend to have an easily accessible hatch, while medium and bigger vessels
have an actual engineering room.

## Airlocks and Hatches

Almost all ships come with small rooms that act as airlocks and hatches. These
rooms have double doors, with one opening out into space. The controls for
presurrising and depressurising can be operated from both sides, although they
can be overriden and locked from the inside. This prevents boarding crews from
entering a vessel easily. Just like any lock this can be hacked with the
_Intrusion_ skill. See the security system module for a list of DCs for
_Hacking_ and _Intrusion_.

### Docking Hatches

Most hatches and modules are also docking hatches, which means that they have
an enclosed tunnel that can be extended to dock to stations or other ships.
