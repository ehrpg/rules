# Secondary Abilities

Apart from the primary abilities, your character also has a set of secondary
abilities. These derive from your abilities, and also change accordingly as they
increase or decrease.

## Hit Points

Hit Points (HP) are an abstraction of your characters physical well being and
remaining health. As your character takes damage he or she loses hit points.
If your character reaches the negative value of it's maximum hit points your
character is dead. Below zero hit points your character is usually negatively
impacted, or even unconscious.

A character's hit points are calculated by adding the ranks of constitution and
strength to 25.

<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
HP = <span data-bracket-bottom="base">25</span>
<span data-bracket-top="rank">+ CON</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="rank">+ STR</span>
</div>

## Speed

Speed is the amount of movement your character can do as part of action. It
is derived by adding the dexterity and strength modifier together and then add
five. A character with zero speed points left is unable to move unless he
applies effort.

<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
Speed = <span data-bracket-bottom="base">5</span>
<span data-bracket-top="mod">+ DEX</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="mod">+ STR</span>
</div>

## Effort

Effort is a pool the represents how much additional effort a character can put
into tasks and skill checks. Applying effort means going above and beyond what
the character is usually capable of doing, usually by pushing him or her to the
limit. It is determined by adding the modifier of strength and constitution
together and multiplying them by two. This value is then added to the base of
ten.

<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
Effort = <span data-bracket-bottom="base">10</span> +
(<span data-bracket-top="mod">CON</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="mod">+ STR</span> ) * 2
</div>

Whenever you do a skill check, do movement using speed or try to damage someone
in melee you can spend effort to boost that skill.

Effort regenerates completely after a full rest of eight hours.

## Carrying Capacity

The maximum weight a character can carry for a longer period of time is defined
by adding the character's constitution and strength rank to 10. The result is
the amount of kgs (kilograms) the character can carry around with him.

<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
Carrying Capacity = <span data-bracket-bottom="base">10</span>
<span data-bracket-top="mod">+ CON</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="mod">+ STR</span>
</div>
