# Abilities

The character has six major abilities, and they define your overall tone of the
character. These abilities have ranks from one to ten, with the average being
five. Each ability also has a modifier, which determines if you gain a benefit
or a disadvantage from your ability rank. The rank is determined whether you are
above or below the average of five. For each rank above the average, you gain
one positive modifier, and for each rank below average you gain a minus rank.

For example Jack has a seven strength, which means he has a plus two modifier
in strength. Whenever Jack does a task related to strength, he can add the plus
two modifier to his roll.

Strength represents your raw physical power. It determines not
only how much a character can lift, drag or push; but also how far he can jump,
or how much damage he does in melee combat.

## ![](/imgs/dexterity.svg){: class="ehicon ehicon-2x"} Dexterity
Dexterity determines your characters fine motor skills and how
well your hand-eye coordination is. It is used in combat with fire arms, and
other skills that require a steady hand, such as piloting a vessel or performing
surgery.

## ![](/imgs/constitution.svg){: class="ehicon ehicon-2x"} Constitution
Constitution determines the physical wellness of your
character. It determines your hit points, as well as endurance and overall
fitness and health of your character.

## ![](/imgs/intelligence.svg){: class="ehicon ehicon-2x"} Intelligence
Intelligence represents how well and fast your character
learns, how well he can think logically, or in abstract terms. It is important
for the sciences and other academic fields.

## ![](/imgs/perception.svg){: class="ehicon ehicon-2x"} Perception
Perception is the awareness of your character. It describes
how well your character can describe his surroundings, either passively or
actively. It determines how well the character finds things that are hidden,
or notices danger.

!!! note
    Charisma may seem underwhelming compared to other abilities. Social
    interaction is a vital aspect of the game, and while you may be tempted to
    omit prioritizing charisma, NPCs and enemies certainly won't. Speak to your
    GM if there is a lot of social interaction in his campaign. If your group is
    f.e. stranded in space, you probably won't have a lot of social
    interactions.

Charisma determines how well your character can interact with others. This
includes force of personality, speech articulation and expressions. It is not
just the overall beauty of a character, but also his appearance and charm.

# Ranks

Your average person has five in all abilities. This means that said person is
not particularly good but also not bad at these abilities. A six means that the
character has spent some amount of training in that area or just has a
natural talent for these sorts of things. The average person that goes out
jogging and bicycling a few times a week might have a constitution of six.
While someone who barely does any sports, might have a constitution of four.

Ranks below three disable your character a lot and you should talk to your
game master first about it. At character creation ranks above seven are also
generally prohibited, unless your game master rules otherwise.

## Raising and lowering

Raising an ability score costs the modifier of the new rank times five. So if
you want to raise an ability from 6 (+1) to 7 (+2) you have to pay ten CCP.
Lowering works the same way, except that you gain that amount of CCP. For
example by lowering your intelligence form 5 to 4 you gain five CCP.

# Your Character

Your character starts with five in all ability scores. You may then use your
CCP to adjust these scores to roughly define your character. Notice that scores
under three and above seven are prohibited - unless your game master rules
otherwise.
