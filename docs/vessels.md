# Overview

This section describes how vessels in Endless Horizons functions. Vessels
incorporate everything the players together can control and range from cars,
helicopters, tanks all the way up to big capital space vessels.

# Operating Vessels

If the vessel is a land craft (such as a car, tank or motorcycle) the skill
_Driving_ is used. For space craft the skill _Pilot Spacecraft_ is used instead.
Should two pilots or drivers enter in a competition against each other, those
skills are pitched against each other. Those skills also replace _Dodge_ to
avoid obstacles.

In many cases the skill _Mechanics_ can be used to make repairs to those
vehicles. Should the vehicle have mounted guns they are operated using the
_Heavy Weapons_ skill. This includes vehicle mounted heavy machine guns, or
firing the canon (or rifle) of a tank.

# Vessel Statistics

## Hit Points

Vessels, just as characters, have hit points. If the hit points reach zero the
vessel is considered _disabled_. This means it will no longer properly operate
and usually all power to its systems are cut. If the vessel reaches its negative
hit points it is complete destroyed, usually killing all crew on board with it.

## Armour

Each vessel may optionally have armour. This armour will always reduce incoming
damage by that amount. Unlike armour of characters, it will never be depleted.

Even the smallest Vehicle armour can stop all small arms fire, except from very
high calibres such as the .50 BMG, the 12.7x108 or above. Anti vehicle weapons
are also highly effective against vehicles with armour, such as RPGs or special
high calibre anti material rifles.

## Shield

Some vehicles come with a shield. This shield gives a given amount of points,
which in case of incoming damage, is always reduced first. Once the shield is
at zero, any incoming damage is done normally to the vessel.

## Modules

Each vessel might optionally have module slots. These module slots can be used
to add additional capabilities to the vessel, such as FTL drives, weapons or
shields. It always depends on the vessel how many module slots exist, and 
whether they can be exchanged and upgraded.

## Crew and Passengers

Vessels may require a certain amount of crew to be present to operate the
vehicle efficiently. Such as modern tanks may require a driver, a gunner and
a commander to operate and maximum efficiency. If a certain amount of crew is
required to operate the vehicle, it is listed in the description of the vehicle.

Passengers are always optional, but many vehicles allow you to bring additional
personnel along for the ride.

## Rooms

Bigger vessels may even offer specific rooms, such as crew quarters, medical
rooms, engineering quarters or docking bays for other vessels. Since ships are
built by large shipyards most ships of one specific type come with the same
layout. Specific layouts are possible, but usually cost extra.

## Docking bays

Larger vessels, medium and above, also sometimes come with a docking bays.
Docking bays house smaller vessels (usually just small vessels). See the ship
details on how many small vessels the ship is capable of housing and operating.
A docking bay also often comes with all necessary equipment to maintain the
smaller vessel, such as repair and refuiling stations.

## Cargo Bays

Cargo bays do just what they say on the tin: Carry and hold cargo. It is
specified in the ship's detailed list on how much cargo the ship is capable of
carrying.

## Speed

The speed factor describes how nimble the aircraft is. For most small vessels
this value is positive, giving the pilot a bonus in dog fights and while evading
enemy fire. Bigger vessels might even have a negative value, representing their
huge mass and slow and sluggish manoeuvring capabilities.

If the speed is not given, this means that the vessel is stationary, either
because the drives have failed, or because the vessel is a station.

## Type

All vessels are given one more types, defining in which environments they
operate in. _Space_ means that the vehicle is capable of manoeuvring in outer
space, _air_ means that is also capable of flying through an atmosphere. If a
vehicle has both _space_ and _air_ listed, the vehicle is capable of making a
transition from atmosphere to outer space and vice versa. _Land_ means that
the vehicle moves on land, and _water_ means that it moves on or in water.

An amphibious troop transporter might have _land_ and _water_ as it's types,
and a huge capital vessel might only have _space_ as it is not capable of
entering an atmosphere.

## Vessel Size

The vessels are split into different size categories. Modules from one size
category are not interchangeable from one size category to another.

### Small Vessels

Small Vessels usually crew around five to ten people. They are the most common
types of vessels, and incorporate things like cars, helicopters, tanks,
transporters and space attack fighters, bombers and other small aircraft.

Small Spacecraft and other small vessels are special in that vessels of higher
size types can usually carry small vessels around with them.

### Medium Vessels

Medium vessels usually have a crew of around 10 to 50 people. Most of the medium
vessels are either space craft, or large water vessels such as submarines or
destroyers. Some medium vessels may even be able to carry a small vessel. Such
as a larger destroyer or frigate may have small landing vessels or attack craft
stored.

### Large Vessels

Large vessels carry around 50 to a 100 crew, and most commonly large space
destroyers, huge cruise liners or massive tanking and trading vessels. They
often come with a fleet of small vessels, to be used as a transfer vessels,
landing vessels or transport and attack craft.

### Capital Vessels

Capital vessels are huge and massive spacecraft and ships that usually hold more
than 150 in crew. They are the backbone of most modern attack fleets and
fearsome in combat. Capital vessels usually hold a massive amount of small
vessels as attack fighters, bombers and transport ships and are usually
accompanied by large vessels and even medium vessels to give them fire support.

Only the biggest armies, largest companies and richest colonies can afford to
build and operate capital vessels. They come with a wide variety of weapons and
their presence alone is often enough to scare enemies into submission.

A special kind of capital vessel that is not used for combat is the colony ship.
It houses everything required to send people to a new planet for terraforming
and colonisation.

# Modules

Vessel modules come in the same sizes as the vessels, and are only compatible
with the vessels of the same size category. Since medium vessels have more power
requirements as a small one, a small power core will not be enough to operate
a medium vessel. Also, a medium power core will simply not fit into a small
vessel.

This page only describes the given modules in detail. See _Vessel Equipment_ for
lists and tables detailing the specific modules and their variations.

## Module Properties

Each module has its own hit points. It is possible to target a specific module
with concentrated fire. In case a hit is successful the hit points of the
module is used instead of the HP of the ship. Shields and armour however protect
the entire ship, including all of the modules and therefore applies to all
modules.

Some modules list requirements of other modules, most often to specific power
cores. The module will not work unless all of its requirements are met. If a
requirement is missing, or becomes damaged and no longer functions, the module
will no longer work.

Specific modules also come with their own set of properties, such as weapons
that will specify their damage, range and reload speed among other things. See
the chapter on _Vehicle Equipment_ for tables and lists of specific modules.

## Sublight Engines

Sublight engines are used to manoeuvre the vessel by simply accelerating it
to some speed below the speed of light. If a vessel has the type _space_ the
engines can also be used to move the vessel in space. Engines that operate
in space do not automatically mean they also operate in an atmosphere.

For a driven vehicle the "sublight engines" are simply the motors, engines and
gear boxes required for the vehicle to operate.

## Life Support Systems

Life support systems are responsible for producing everything that is required
to keep the crew alive. They range from oxygen, water and waste recyclers, to
crew quarters, and food processors. Any stasis chambers (such as cryo-chambers)
are also part of the life support systems.

## Power Cores

Power cores, or reactors are responsible for giving the vehicle enough power
to operate systems and other modules. They range from small car batteries, up
to large reactors on large capital vessels. Without them the vehicle usually
does not operate, and they thus considered a critical part of the vessel.

## Shield Generators

Shield generates are responsible for generating a protective shield around the
vessel to soak up incoming damage. A shield generator has a power requirement,
usually a special type of power generator that is required to operate the
shield. The shield points define how much damage the shield will soak up before
it collapses, and the recharge rate determines how much shield is regenerated
per round.

## Sensor array

The sensor array provides communications, sub light sensors (such as radar) and
other means of communications such as SOS beacons. It can also be used to scan
for other ships, planet or distress beacons and is needed to plot course for FTL
drives.

## Hull

The hull is the name for the various parts of the ship that covers things such
as rooms, or other modules. It is no specific part, but just keeps the ship
together in one piece.

## Bridge or Cockpit

The bridge in larger vessels, or cockpit in smaller ones, houses all the
controls required for the pilot (or pilots) to operate and fly the vehicle.
On spaceships it is often hidden somewhere inside with the pilot being provided
visual link and feed to see where he or she is going. On land and air vehicles
it is often directly accessible from the outside.

## Weapons

Weapons are usually directly mounted onto the vessel. They are either controlled
by the pilot directly, by a gunner or on larger vessels by an AI. To aim and
fire vessel weapons the skill _Heavy Weapons_ is used.

There are a wide variety of weapons available for vessels:

- _Dumb fire rockets_: Rockets that just fly straight. The skill _Heavy Weapons_
is used to fire and hit with these rockets.
- _Missiles_: Rockets and missiles that have some sort of targeting system. They
have their own _piloting_ and _speed_ skills that determines if they hit their
target or not.
- _Rail guns_: Large batteries that accelerate mass using a magnetic field. They
are the most common type of weapons for ship to ship combat.
- _Point Defence_: Often multiple batteries of Gatling guns that are used to
fire at missiles, or ships at very close ranges.
- _Canons_: Large canons that fire huge projectiles, such as the canons on
tanks, and anti-infantry vehicles.

All of these weapons require ammunition and power to operate. See the detailed
list and tables of _Vessel Equipment_ for available weapons.

## FTL Drives

FTL drives allow the vessel to go faster than light in various ways. There are
multiple drives available, each with their own benefits and disadvantages.

### Hyperspace

TODO

### Warp

TODO

### Wormhole

The wormhole drive is fastest among the FTL drives, and allows near instant
transportation between two points. It however does not fit onto small vessels.
Opening and maintaining a stable wormhole requires huge amounts of power.

Once the wormhole is opened the travel only goes one way (from the point the
hole has been opened). As long as the wormhole is open ships can fly through it,
although once the ship has flown through that has opened the wormhole, it
collapses.

Things that do not actively steer through the wormhole will exit it at a random
point in space and are considered lost in space.

Opening a wormhole near an object with a huge amount of mass (such as a planet,
sun, or moon) is not possible.

Many large colonies usually operate a wormhole station that can be used, for a
fee, to fly to other large colonies nearly instantly.
