# Overview

Backgrounds are a predefined set of skills adhering to a specific skill.
Picking a background makes it easier to build a character, but is only
optional. A background costs a certain amount of CCP and comes with
a set of skills that are unlocked and bought up to a certain rank, and
usually with an ability increase. This increase in ability rank stacks
with whatever you have chosen at character creation.

These backgrounds are also slightly cheaper than picking all these skills
by hand, although not by much. Backgrounds also represent special jobs and
careers a character could have gone through before choosing a life as
adventurer.

# Creating Backgrounds

It's of course up the game master to design and incorporate new backgrounds
to his game. A background should always come with at least one ability rank
increase and set of skills unlocked and at a lower tier rank. Each ability
rank counts as costing five (5) CCP. Then add the costs for the skills
together and round down to the next number dividable through five 5.

# Buying Backgrounds

Backgrounds can only be bought at character creation, as they represent a
past education, career or lifestyle. Although it is possible to buy more than
one background at character creation.

For example someone who wishes to buy an arms dealer would perhaps by the
_Criminal_ and _Trader_ background. A combat medic (Corpsman) would pick the
_Soldier_ and the _Paramedic_. A space trader might be a _Spacecraft Pilot_
and _Trader_ at once, and maybe add a few covert skills to this mix to become
a smuggler.

If two backgrounds provide the same bonuses (ability increases or ranks in
skills) only the highest one applies. The ability increases however do stack
with whatever ability modifications you made at character creation.
