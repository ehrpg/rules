# Environmental Hazards

The fire arms and combat are not the only thing that can pose harm to the
players. Environmental Hazards, such as radiation, toxic fumes and fire.
Also the biggest threat for any crew is the vast vacuum that is space.

## Acid

Acid or corrosive effects also deals 1d6 points of damage to a character.
A suits _hazard_ rating may reduce the damage. Falling into a vat of acid
and being completely submerged causes 10d6 points of damage per round.

## Cold

An unprotected character in cold environments (below 5 degrees Celsius)
must make a constitution check every hour, against a DC of 5, +1 for each
additional hour of exposure or take 1d6 points of damage.

An unprotected character inn conditions of severe cold (below -20 degrees
Celsius) must make the same check every ten minutes, or take 1d6 points of
damage.

Extreme cold (below -40 degrees Celsius) deals 1d6 points of damage per minute,
and no save is allowed, to an unprotected character.

Cold damage cannot be cured until the character gets out of the cold and warms
up. If the character warms up he cures the cold damage over the course of one
hour per each damage he or she has suffered.

## Darkness

In darkness a character is considered blinded, unless he has a visual aid, such
as night vision or thermal imaging goggles.

See the _blinded_ state in the _Injury and Death_ regarding for further rules.

Low light environment, for example those just illuminated by emergency lights,
will and should incur penalties to the DC of tasks that require perception. It
is up the game master to set this DC. A rule of thumb is that the range of this
penalty should lie between +1 and +5, depending on illumination.

Creatures with echolocation or scent abilities can still use these methods to
move about and act normally in complete darkness. Some creatures might even be
possible to see normally in darkness or low light environments.

## Falling

The basic rule is: for every three metres a character falls he takes 1d6
points of damage.

If a character deliberately jumps the three metres, he may make an
_acrobatics_ check against the first set of damage, with a DC of 5 plus the
metres fallen, to avoid the 1d6 points of damage.

Should the ground be soft or giving the threshold of when damage begins is
increased. Landing on soft pillow cushions, or a training mat will allow a
person to fall three or up to five metres higher without taking damage.

The same applies by falling into deep waters. If the water is deep enough, the
player can jump into water from roughly twenty metres without taking damage.
For every five metres above that you still take 1d6 points of damage.

## Fire Hazards

Fire hazards come in various shapes in sizes. The most common hazards though
do 1d6 points of fire damage. It is up to the game master and the situation
to allow a player a dodge away from a fire hazard. For example if a small gas
leak catches fire, and would otherwise harm the player, the game master might
rule that the player can dodge out of the way of the fire stream.

A suits _hazard_ rating may reduce the damage from fire hazards. The suit
may still catch fire though.

If the player catches on fire, he takes an additional 1d6 fire damage each
round until the fire is put out. Taking out out the fire takes a dexterity
or strength check against a fixed DC of 7.

Another player can help, either with some sort of fire blanket or fire
extinguisher.

Also note that fire needs an oxygen environment to work, and the the most common
way to remove fire hazards on ships is to vent the air in said room to space.

## Radiation Hazards

Radiation is prevalent in space, on space walks say, certain planets or things
that require fuel are damaged. Damaged cores or damaged FTL drives may
radiation depending on how much they are damaged.

It is up to the game master to define the radiation that is present in the
background. The background radiation can be confined to a specific area, but
should always be a _flat number_. If a person or character is present in a
contaminated area, he takes this flat number as wound damage for every minute
he is in the area. The radiation damage thus reduces his maximum hit points.
This wounding damage does not incur any additional wounds.

The wounding damage, represents radiation sickness, and must be cured
appropriately. A doctor can cure radiation poisoning just like any other wound,
see _Injury and Death_. Suits can protect against radiation, and provide flat
resistance to radiation damage.

## Lack of Air

For every minute a person is deprived of breathable air, he may make a check
with his constitution modifier to see if he starts suffocating. The DC
starts at 5 and increases by +2 for every additional minute. On the first failed
check he starts to suffocate, and takes 1d6 damage each round.

If the player reaches zero hit points he automatically becomes unconscious, and
if he reaches negative maximum hit points he dies.

As long as he has not reached negative maximum hit points, a person capable of
_first aid_ or _medicine_ can resuscitate him by supplying oxygen and by making
an appropriate skill check against a DC of 8. If the check is successful the
character regains conscious and regains any suffocation damage over a course of
one minute.

## Starvation and Thirst

Characters might find themselves out of food and water, and without the means
of obtaining them. In normal climates a person requires 2 litres of water per
day, and in hot environments even up to four litres per day.

A character can go without water for one day plus a number of hours equal to
his _constitution rank_. For each additional hour afterwards without
water the character must make a constitution check against a DC of 5
plus the numbers of hours passed, or take 1d6 points of damage.

Characters can go without food for three days, in growing discomfort. After that
time the character has to make constitution check against a DC of 5 plus one for
each additional day or take 1d6 points of damage.
