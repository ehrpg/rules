# Overview

Everything in Endless Horizons is done by making a _check_ against a given
_difficulty_. It is the player's job to make the check, while it is the game
masters job to keep track of the difficulty. When bonuses or penalties are
given in tihs document, they usually apply to the difficulty and _not the check_
that the player makes.

This is important as the player probably does not, and should not, know all
the factors that make his work harder or easier. As a game master you should
always be as transparent as possible, when it comes to determining the
difficulty.

Although the rules are rather specific for most circumstances, the game master
should always adjust the difficulty of tasks according the specific situation.
For example, a fog can add from +1 to +6 to the difficulty of a task, to
identify another person depending on how thick the fog is.

# Rolling

Almost all of the skill checks in Endless Horizons are done by rolling a ten
sided die (d10). The player adds relevant bonuses from his her character,
while the game master calculates the difficulty. If the player's result is
at or above the difficulty the check is successful.

If the player rolls a one (1) or a ten (10) he has caused the dice to escalate.
The player rolls again until either he rolls a number that is not one or ten,
or until he has rolled three times in total. Rolling a ten gives a minor
positive effect, rolling a one adds minor negative effect. Rolling two tens or
two ones in a row adds a medium positive or negative effect; and rolling three
ones or tens in a row adds a major positive or negative effect to the outcome
off the task.

Positive and negative effects cancel each other out. So if the player rolls a
one, and then rolls a ten; these two effects cancel each other. If the player
rolls a ten, then another ten and finally a one, the result is just minor
positive effect as one _ten_ and the _one_ cancel each other.

A check is not automatically failed when rolling a one. A check only fails if
the result does not meet the difficulty.

# Effects

When the player achieves a minor, medium or major effect it is up the game
master to decide what happens. These effects happen regardless of whether the
check succeeds or not.

Minor positive effects grant a small immediate bonus (for example extra
damage, or the task is done faster), while minor negative effects do the
opposite. For example a task could take longer to complete, or the player
does less damage than normal.

Medium effects give major bonuses (for example they might take down the target
outright) or major disadvantages, for example the weapon jams and needs to be
cleared and reloaded before it is usable again.

Major effects are relatively rare, but may bring devastating results not only
for the player in question but maybe also for others around him, or allow him
to achieve the seemingly impossible.

Example: The player wishes to shoot a small burst with his rifle against a
target down the hallway. He rolls a 1, but after all the bonuses are added
the GM determines that he hits. The player rolls again (a 6) and breaks the
escalating die. He hits, although with a minor negative effect. The game
master decided that in the heat of battle the player overshot, and spent
more bullets than he intended. The player shot a burst of ten instead of five,
yet none of the extra bullets hit any enemies.

# Contests

When two players, or a player and an NPC, use their skills against each other,
they are rolling in a contest. Both players pitch their respectives rolls
against each other, applying relevant bonuses, and whoever has the highest
result wins. On a draw, the party who initiated the contest wins.

# Applying Effort

On all rolls of the dice that determine an outcome for the player, the player
may spend effort points. He has to declare so, before making the
roll. The amount of effort he wishes to spend must not exceed his
remaining effort pool. Also any points the player spends is added to
the result dice roll, if any.

## Skills

For applying effort to skills, a character can only use as much effort
as he has ranks in that skills.

## Movement
When applying effort for movement in combat, a character can only use
as much effort as the character has speed.
