When a character performs complex operations a skill is
involved. Whether it be operating a vehicle, shooting a firearm,
climbing a steep cliff or trying to convince another character or
NPC.

## Abilities

Each skill is associated with one ability. The abilities do not directly
influence the difficulty set forth by the DM but give the player a slight
advantage nonetheless. For example, a person with high strength may add
his ability bonus to any damage he does in melee combat. See the skills
description on what sort of bonuses are associated with having a positive
or negative ability modifier.

Furthermore the ability modifier associated with a skill also determines
how much effort you may apply to a given skill check. A modifier of zero,
or below does not allow you use any effort in a skill check associated
with that ability.

For example, Jack the soldier has strength of 7 and intelligence of 4,
with a +2 and -1 modifier respectively. He may expend two effort in a
_melee combat_ skill check (which is based on strength), but cannot
expend effort in a _medicine_ check (which is based on intelligence).

## Proficiency

Each skill has five grades of proficiency: untrained, trained, experienced,
expert and mastered.

Each person is considered _untrained_ within a given skill by default.
This means that the character may roll one ten sided dice when
attempting a skill check. Once he has actually learned the skill the
character is considered _trained_. The character may add an additional
ten sided dice to skill checks (to a total to 2d10). The difference between
a _trained_ and _experienced_ character is having used the skill for years
in real world scenarios. Such an _experienced_ character gains an
additional ten sided dice (to a total of 3d10). The _expert_ has used
and heavily trained this skill for years. Few match his expertise, and he
may add an additional ten sided dice to his or her skill checks (to a
total of 4d10). Above the experts are those who have truly _mastered_
the skill. They are allowed to add an additional ten sided dice, to a
total of 5d10.

| Skill rank | Dice   | CCP Cost
+------------+--------+----------
| Untrained  | 1d10   |  -
| Trained    | 2d10   |  5
| Experienced| 3d10   | 10
| Expert     | 4d10   | 15
| Master     | 5d10   | 20

All skills are unlocked for the character at the _untrained_ stage by
default. To advance the skill to the next level the character has to
expend the given amount of CCP (see the table above).

## Making a skill check

The DM is responsible for defining which skill is to be used, and also
has to set the difficulty of the check. The player then rolls the
amount of dices granted to him and announces whether and how many
successes he or she has.

## Multiple checks

More often than not the player wishes to achieve multiple things within
one action of combat. For example the player might wish to jump down a
ledge, and the immediately roll behind cover. Under normal circumstances
these would be two actions, and thus two rolls of acrobatics. Should the
player however have more than one dice available in the given skill, he
or she may attempt more than one action at once in a single action.

The player must state the intention of what he or she wishes to do, and
the DM must specify whether this requires more than one action or not.
A player may only attempt as many actions at once as he has dices
available. For example a trained shooter may attempt to aim and shoot
at the same time. The DM decides that this requires two successes and
defines a _combined_ DC for both actions. Now the player has to roll all
his or her dices and meet the number of required successes.

Example: Hannes wishes to aim and shoot at another NPC. Since his
character is an experienced marksman. He has 3d10 available and thus
wishes to do everything in one action. Since Hannes is also aiming the
DM decides to lessen the difficulty from the initial 5 to 4 but requires
two successes. Hannes now has to achieve two dice rolls of four or higher
upon rolling his three ten sided dices to succeed.

Doing more than one thing per action is optional. The player can also
split up these tasks into multiple actions. However, a trained character
can use this system to get more things done faster, and possibly provide
him an edge over others that did not invest into those skills.

## Knowledge Skills

Almost all skills allow you make knowledge checks. Here you don't actively
perform the skill, but rather determine whether your character knows a
specific information in regards to the specific skill. Knowledge roles
always use intelligence instead of whatever main ability that skill is
normally associated with. The player rolls to determine whether his character
knows this information. A character can usually attempt this roll once
per positive intelligence modifier, with a minimum of one roll.

For example: Jack, a soldier, wishes to know what sorts of guns are usually
mounted on a T-130 heavy tank, and whether they could be a dangered to
his heavily armed landing ship. He rolls Heavy Weapons against a DC, but
instead benefits from a high intelligence instead of perception.

The game master should always allow a player character to learn about topics he
or she doesn't know about. During down time it is always possible to learn
new things by reading books, experimenting or by just asking the internet.
Knowing, or not knowing, by the use of knowledge skills usually matters
during action or combat. The T-130 will not wait until Jack has browsed the
internet for the specifications of the T-130's main turrent gun.
