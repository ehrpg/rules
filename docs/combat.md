This chapter deals with ranged and melee combat between characters. Ship to ship
combat is defined in its own section in the chapter that deals with Vessels.

# Actions

Every participant in combat may choose to take three actions per turn. The
participant can take 1 _action_, 1 _reaction_ and 1 _free action_. Perks,
items or other specialties of a character may modify the amount of actions he
or she may take.

Actions are activities the player may choose to perform during his turn. Be it
shooting or aiming a firearm, performing a skill check or running across a
hallway to reach an elevator. Valid actions are:

- Use the character's speed points for movement.
- Use a non-complicated item, like reloading a firearm, pull the pin and
  throwing a grenade etc.
- Attack an enemy.
- Aim at an enemy.
- Perform a skill check.

A _reaction_ is an action that is only performed if a certain condition is
fulfilled. The reaction is valid until the next turn of the character who
declared it. If its condition does not kick in, the action is lost. If the
condition kicks, in the player begins his action during the action that
triggered it.

Sometimes the game master may wish to declare a contest between the participant
that does the action and the one that does the reaction. For example, one
participant has a reaction in place to draw his gun, if the opponent reaches
for his firearm. The game master decides that a dexterity challenge is required
to determine who draws first. Both players roll a ten sided dice and add any
dexterity modifier to the result. The participant with the highest result
wins and draws his gun before the other.

Free actions are small actions that take little to no time. Usually only
one free action is allowed per turn. Talking up to ten words is considered a
free action.

# Movement

A character can use his available speed points as part of an action to move
about in the battle field. The general rule is that, for each point of speed
available to the character he may move one metre.

Certain actions use up more than speed points than others. See the table below
to determine how many speed points are expended for various actions.

| Action     | Movement points
|------------|-----------------
| Movement   | 1 per metre
| Running    | 1 per two metres
| Jumping    | 2 per metre
| Jumping (running headstart) | 1 per metre
| Crawling   | 2 per metre
| Climbing   | 3 per metre
| Changing combat stance | 1
| Change stance from prone | 2

When changing stance a character has to expend one speed point. If the character
is _prone_ he has to expend two speed points to exchange stance.

Any terrain that hinders a persons movement is considered _difficult terrain_.
Such terrain doubles the amount of speed points needed for any sort of movement,
except changing stance. The following are examples of difficult terrain: stairs,
uphill slopes, snow, mudd or wet surfaces.

If a character is out of speed points the character cannot move anymore. He
may however spend one of his actions in a round to regain his speed points.

A character can use effort points in case of speed points, or if the character
is out speed points. Effort points can also be used in addition to speed points,
if the character does not have enough to complete a movement. For example if
the character has to run for three metres, and then make a one metre jump across
a cavern, but only has 2 speed points left; he may chose to take the remaining
two from his effort pool.

# Turns

Combat takes place in turns. Each player plots what he wishes to do, and
communicates this to the GM. A player may plot all of his actions (as stated
above).

Upon all players have decided upon their actions and informed the GM, each
player rolls initiative to see when he gets to act. Rolling initiative is done
by rolling a ten sided die (d10) and adding the _dexterity_ modifier and
any other relevant bonuses. Then all player characters do their actions in the
order they rolled initiative. Non player characters behave in the same way,
and also reroll their initiative each round. Everyone may chose to spend effort
points, with each spent effort point increasing the initiative by one. This must
be done before rolling for initiative.

In an alternate system (as preferred by Johannes) each participant of combat
rolls their initiative at the beginning, which then remains fixed throughout the
encounter. This system is preferable if you find that your encounters last too
long and you wish to speed them up.

## Surprise Round

One side of the encounter can initiate a surprise round, if the other side of
the encounter is unaware. The surprising round gains one full round, in which
the surprised side cannot use any actions. After that surprise round, the
encounter continues normally.

# Melee Combat

A player character can engage another in melee combat if they are close to each
other (up to a metre). To attack another opponent in melee roll a skill check
of the _Melee Combat_ skill. If it counts as a _surprise attack_ the
opponent is not allowed to dodge or block and must take the attack. If attacker
hits, he rolls for damage. See the equipment section for weapons and their
damage.

If the opponent is aware of the attack he may now use one of his actions this
round to dodge the attack. If he has no more actions left, he cannot dodge. To
dodge the attack the opponent makes a _Dodge_ check against the attacker's
attack check. If the defender exceeds the attack roll he has successfully evaded
the attack and takes no damage.

Should the opponent be out of actions for this turn, he may only block the
attack. The opponent rolls a ten sided die (d10) and adds _Strength_ and
_Constitution_ modifiers to the dice result. If he exceeds the attack roll,
he has successfully blocked the attack, and damage received is halved. Otherwise
the damage is taken in full.

# Ranged Combat

Ranged combat works differently. A player chooses to engage another in ranged
combat, takes aim and fires. The player who is being targeted has no chance
usually has little change to evade (except on extreme distances). The difficulty
of landing a successful hit depends on several factors:

- Size: The difficulty increases if the target is smaller or decreases if the
target is bigger.
- Range: Depending on the weapon in question, targets get harder to hit at
longer ranges.
- Stances: Various stances can decrease the difficulty. A person firing a
fully automatic rifle while standing, has a low chance of hitting than a
person who fires single shots from the prone position.
- Movement: A moving target is hard to hit, especially at further ranges. This
also applies if the shooter is moving while trying to aim.
- Environmental: Darkness, strong winds and impaired vision can all affect on how
well a character can hit a target.

The game master calculates the difficulty of the task depending on these factors
and player rolls an appropriate skill check. If he reaches it or exceeds the
difficulty he scores a hit.

## Cover

The best way to protect oneself from fire is to hide beneath or behind cover.
Depending on the material of the cover bullets may still be able to penetrate
the cover and cause damage to the people behind the cover.

For example most bullets can penetrate a wooden cover, whereas a .50 BMG is even
capable of tearing through brick walls.

## Size

The game separates targets into size categories. An average human standing is
considered a _medium_ target. The same average human that is either sitting on
the floor or kneeling is considered a _small_ target. The same person in the
prone position is considered _tiny_. These size categories do not change
depending on the distance from the shooter. They just help to categorize the
targets. For example a big dog would be considered a _small_ target, while a
sneaking would count as _tiny_.

Targets larger than a human also have their own size categories. A car, for
example is considered a _large_ target. So are some other vehicles that fit
roughly the same size. Bigger targets are considered _huge_, for example large
vehicles (main battle tanks, MRAPs, IVFs) or even space ships.

## Range

The range to a target is always given rough estimate in metres. The game master
should avoid making a science of it, and should operate in rough estimates.

The gun play mechanics then categorize these ranges into what is called an
_effective range_. This is a metric used in conjunction
with firearms to determine how effective they are at certain ranges. The authors
know that firearms are more complicated than that, and much of it depends on the
skill of the shooter involved. Still this metric is used for abstraction and for
balancing reasons.

The _effective range_ is broadly defined as the distance an average shooter
should be able to hit a _medium_ target half of the time. Other ranges are
derived from this in fractions:

- _Maximum_: Between _effective range_ and half the _effective range_.
- _Far_: Between _maximum_ and a quarter of the _effective range_.
- _Medium_: Between _far_ and an eights of the _effective range_.
- _Close_: Below an eights of the _effective range_.

For example, let's assume a Glock 17 has an effective range of 50 metres. The
ranges are thus as following: _Maximum_ is between 50 and 25 metres. _Far_
between 25 and 12.5 metres. _Medium_ between 12.5 metres and six metres, and
_close_ is everything closer than six metres.

The size category of the target and the range category are combined and lead
to the following table of penalties for the difficulty task:

| Size    | Close | Medium | Far | Maximum
|---------|-------|--------|-----|--------
| Tiny    | +3    | +6     | +12 | +18
| Small   | +2    | +4     | +8  | +12
| Medium  | +1    | +2     | +4  | +6
| Large   | -12   | -8     | -4  | -2
| Huge    | -18   | -12    | -6  | -3

## Movement

Movement is also categorized into four categories: _still_, _subtle_, _slow_
and _fast_. A normal human being standing is considered moving _subtly_ as no
person normally stands perfectly still. Objects may as well stand perfectly
_still_, as in their movement is not noticeable. So do living beings who are
perhaps bound, unconscious or otherwise incapable of moving. _Slow_ movement
incorporates anything at the speed of an average human walking. _Fast_ is
anything that moves at a speed of an average human sprinting or above.

The penalties are as followed:

| Still | Subtle | Slow | Fast |
|-------|--------|------|------|
| -2    | 0      | +2   | +4   |

These penalties apply for both a moving target, and a shooter that is moving. So
a player who is running and shooting at a target that is also running as a
cumulative penalty of plus eight (+8).

## Stance

A person firing can be in one of the following firing stances: _standing_,
_kneeling_, _prone firing_, and _prone_. Standing also makes the person in
question a medium target, _kneeling_ makes him a small and _prone_ and
_prone firing_ a tiny target.

The difference between _prone_ and _prone firing_ is that a prone firing is an
actual rifle stance. The prone firing position gives an aiming advantage,
while prone does not. If a person falls on the floor, or is knocked down he is
considered _prone_ instead of being in the _prone firing_ position.

The penalties for the stances are as followed:

| Stance       | Penalty |
|--------------|---------|
| Standing     | -1
| Kneeling     | -2
| Prone firing | -3
| Prone        | +2

## Taking Aim

A character is always considered to at least raise is weapon, aim shortly and
the fire by default.

But a character may expend an action to take careful aim. The difficulty is
reduced by two (2) for each action he chooses to take aim for. The bonus is lost
if he doesn't fire in the same round he also take aim for.

## Bursts and Full Auto

Each weapon which is capable of burst firing or fully automatic has a recoil
modifier. Each subsequent bullet adds this recoil modifier to the difficulty.
Regardless only one attack roll is made for the burst. As many bullets of the
burst hit as the attack roll meets or exceeds in difficulty. While the
progression is linear (per bullet) in a real life scenario it is perfectly
reasonable for the first bullet to hit, the second to miss and the third to
hit again.

Example: A player wishes to shoot a three round burst at a target. The
difficulty is determined to be 16 and the recoil modifier of the gun is 2.
The player rolls a 19. This means that the first bullet (difficulty 16) hits,
the second does as well (as the player's 19 is above 16 plus 2) but the third
bullet does not (19 is below 20).

## Suppressing Fire

Sometimes it is necessary to keep the enemy sitting ducks. Usually to allow
someone else to flank around, or to cover the get away of others. With
suppressing fire you have to fire a certain amount bullets towards the
enemies you wish to suppress for each action you wish to suppress them. This
includes your actions, those of your allies and the actions of the enemy. The
amount of bullets required is determined by the game master. Depending on the
situation. The game master may even allow you to fire and aim at an enemy out of
turn if they leave their cover while you suppress them.

If you run out of bullets and have to reload you have to await your turn to
reload and the suppression ends.

The game master has to determine the bullets required. For example, covering a
simple narrow corridor (with enemies left and right of the door) usually
requires just one bullets per action. While a wide open area with natural
cover and enemies advancing may require a short burst per cover.

The rule of thumb is, that one shooter with one bullet per action can
effectively suppress one lane of attack (i.e. one hallway, one street). If
the area is wide and open, a small burst (of three to five bullets) is usually
required to keep one group of advancing enemies at bay.

Despite common misconception it is not required to fire full auto to achieve
a suppression effect. If a sharp shooter covers a narrow side alley and takes
single shots at anyone who wishes to cross, the enemies will still think twice
before crossing.

## Reloading

Reloading a firearms takes a certain amount of actions. If not otherwise noted
in the description of the firearm, it takes one action to reload the firearm.

If the firearm uses magazines, that means swapping the empty magazine for a new
one and cocking the gun. Reloading magazines themselves is generally not
possible during a firefight.

## Drawing

Drawing a pistol or a knife from a holster takes one action. The same applies
if you carry the pistol or knife conceiled on your body (but still using a
holster). The same applies if you carry the knife or the pistol in a slot of
a body armor.

If the weapon is not in a slot of an armor, or in a holster (i.e. hidden in
a boot, in your pocket, a rucksack or shouldered) it takes two actions to
draw the weapon.

## Hiding

You can hide small weapons (Pistols, PDWs) on your body. This is not the same
as doing conceiled carry. Use your _stealth_ skill to hide the weapon on
your body. Anybody searching you must use an apposing _notice_ check to
find the hidden weapon on you, but gains a -5 on his difficulty task, as finding
a weapon is easier than hiding one. If someone wishes to determine from a
distance if you are armed or not, he must also make a _notice_ check, but does
not gain any benefit.

## Malfunctions

Firearms are mechanical devices that can fail. Wear and tear, or inproper
cleaning and handling can contribute to these malfunctions or stoppages. There
are variety of possible malfunctions, ranging from temporary to relative save
malfunctions to potentially dangerous ones that can permanently damage the gun
or cause injury or death.

These malfunctions are candidates for minor or medium negative effects.

A minor fault is a _failure to feed_ (FTF) when the firearm fails to feed
the next cartridge into the chamber from a magazine. It can also be caused by
not holding the fire arm properly (``limp wristing''). It can usually be cleared
in one action and does not immediately threaten the shooter. It does however
stop a burst or fully automatic fire.

A stovepipe (_failure to eject_) occours when the spent casing is not
properly ejected from the firearm, causing it to jam the ejection port. It
presents no immediate danger to the shooter and can be cleared in one action. It
does however stop a burst or fully automatic fire.

A severe major fault is a so called _squib load_ where the projectile does
not have enough force to exit the barrel and becomes stuck. A subsequent bullet
fired afterwards can cause catastrophic failure, causing damage to the firearm
and injury to the shooter.

## Determining Difficulty

The base difficulty for ranged attacks is five (5). Then you combine the size
category and the range category and add it. Then you add a movement penalty,
if the target is moving or the shooter is moving. Then you add stance modifiers,
any environmental modifiers and any miscellaneous modifiers.

_Example_: A player wishes to fire a three round burst with his rifle
(recoil modifier of 2) (range 300 metres) at a small target roughly 100 metres
out. It is dusk and the game master decides that he has an additional penalty
of +2 for from low light conditions. The player as a dexterity and perception
modifier of +1, and three ranks in the appropriate skill. The difficulty is
determined as following:


<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
DC = <span data-bracket-bottom="base">5</span>
<span data-bracket-top="range">+ 8</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="low light">+ 1</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="stance">- 1</span>
= 13
</div>

The player rolls the following:

<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
1d10 = <span data-bracket-bottom="roll">8</span>
<span data-bracket-top="dexterity">+ 1</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="perception">+ 1</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="skill">+ 3</span>
= 13
</div>

And scores one hit. The other two of his bullets miss.

# Thrown Weapons

Thrown weapons (throwing knives, axes and hand grenades) are handled just like
other ranged weapons, except that a different skill is used in the checks:
_Throwing_. Thrown weapons also have an _effective range_ and cause
damage just like a bullet from a firearm would.

## Grenades

Throwing a grenade at a specific area (for example next or behind a cover) is
usually considered a range task with a _medium_ target (the area). Any special
circumstances might reduce or widen the size. For example throwing a grenade
into a window would cause the target to be _small_ (for a small window), or
casting a grenade into a small man-hole might even be considered a _tiny_
target.

Most hand held explosive grenades have what is called an _effective_ and an
_casualty_ radius. Everyone within the _effective_ radius, that is not
protected by grenade proof cover, dies. Within the _casualty_ radius a grenade
deals enough damage to kill or incapacitate all of the targets.

Grenades cause two types of damage: _bludgeoning_ from the explosive shock
wave, and piercing _piercing_ from the flying shrapnel. Due to the massive
amounts of shrapnel only full cover or full body armour can protect against
the piercing damage.

# Damage

The weapon used always determines the amount and type of damage that can be
caused to another. A knife for example can deal piercing or slashing damage
depending how it's being used. A firearm usually causes piercing and
bludgeoning damage. Hits with bare fists may just cause bludgeoning damage.

Other forms of damage are of course also possible, for example a player can
take fire damage from an open flame, or acid damage from being exposed to
acids or other corrosive fluids.

## Zones

When a player hits another, either with a ranged or melee weapon, the attacking
player rolls two six sided die (2d6) to determine where he scores a hit.

The target then determines if he has clothing or armor that protects him in this
region and substracts any relevant damage reductions from the incoming damage.
If any damage is left the target resolves any effects of the target area (for
example damage multiplier) and substracts that number from his hit points.

If the target survives it, he then has to roll another check to see if the
injury causes a wound. See the chapter _Injury and Death_ regarding rules
for wounds.

Aiming for a specific zone is possible. The size modifier of the target is
reduced one step any body part except the vital organs, and by two steps for
vital organs. If the reduction is not possible because the size modifier would
be beneath "tiny" then aiming at it the zone specifically is not possible. If
the attack succeeds the zone is hit automatically without a need to roll the two
six sided dices.

The following is a hit zone for a human or human-like creature:

| Result | Zone         | Effect
|--------|--------------|---------------
| 2      | Vital Organ  | Special, Damage * 6
| 3,4    | Legs         |
| 5,6,7  | Torso        | Damage * 2
| 8,9    | Arms         |
| 10, 11 | Head         | Damage * 3
| 12     | Vital Organ  | Special, Damage * 6

## Vital Organs

Most creatures, animals (including humans) have vital organs. Any damage
to those areas is usually fatal. For humans these areas would be the brain
and the heart. Damage to the vital organs follows special rules, usually
depending on the creature involved. However if - after applying these special
rules - any damage is done to the vital organ this damage is multiplied by
six (6).

### Humans

Humans have two vital organs: The _heart_ and the _brain_. Both the brain and
the heart are usually protected either by the skull or the rib cage. Any
bludgeoning damage below _ten_ (10) is automatically converted into a hit
towards the surrounding hit zone (torso for heart, and head for
brain). Slashing damage cannot harm either of those vital two organs unless
they are exposed. Any piercing damage above _two_ (2) can easily penetrate the
rib cage or skull and does full damage. Any piercing damage below _two_ is
stopped by the bone and negated.
