# Introduction

This section will guide you through the character creation. Characters in
Endless Horizons are your average Joe and Jane, that fight for survival in
the ultimate hostile environment: space.

# Character Creation Points

All characters are built and advanced with Character Creation Points (CCP).
You receive a given amount, specified by your game master at the start of the
campaign, and you receive more as you go through the campaign. They are
awarded as your character defeats enemies, finish quests and get over the
dangers in the galaxy.

With CCP you can buy ability increases, improve skills, and even allow you to
get special features and perks for your character.

For most games you will start with 50 CCP. But it is always up to the game
master, and he or she might adjust the number to fit the theme of his game.

# Abilities

The character has six major abilities, and they define your overall tone of the
character. These abilities have ranks from one to ten, with the average being
five. Each ability also has a modifier, which determines if you gain a benefit
or a disadvantage from your ability rank. The rank is determined whether you are
above or below the average of five. For each rank above the average, you gain
one positive modifier, and for each rank below average you gain a minus rank.

For example Jack has a seven strength, which means he has a plus two modifier
in strength. Whenever Jack does a task related to strength, he can add the plus
two modifier to his roll.

- _Strength_: Strength represents your raw physical power. It determines not
only how much a character can lift, drag or push; but also how far he can jump,
or how much damage he does in melee combat.

- _Dexterity_: Dexterity determines your characters fine motor skills and how
well your hand-eye coordination is. It is used in combat with fire arms, and
other skills that require a steady hand, such as piloting a vessel or performing
surgery.

- _Constitution_: Constitution determines the physical wellness of your
character. It determines your hit points, as well as endurance and overall
fitness and health of your character.

- _Intelligence_: Intelligence represents how well and fast your character
learns, how well he can think logically, or in abstract terms. It is important
for the sciences and other academic fields.

- _Perception_: Perception is the awareness of your character. It describes
how well your character can describe his surroundings, either passively or
actively. It determines how well the character finds things that are hidden,
or notices danger.

- _Charisma_: Charisma determines how well your character can interact with
others. This includes force of personality, speech articulation and expressions.
It is not just the overall beauty of a character, but also his appearance and
charm.

## Ranks

Your average person has five in all abilities. This means that said person is
particularly good but also not bad at these abilities. A six means that the
character has spent some good amount of training in that area or just has a
natural talent for these sorts of things. The average person that goes out
jogging and bicycling a few times a week might have a constitution of six.
While someone who barely does any sports, might have a constitution of four.

Ranks below three disable your character a lot and you should talk to your
game master first about it. At character creation ranks above seven are also
generally prohibited, unless your game master rules otherwise.

### Raising and lowering

Raising an ability score costs exactly as much CCP as the rank you are raising
the ability to. For example, if you want to raise strength from five to six, you
have to pay six CCP.

Lowering works the same way, you gain as much CCP as it would cost to raise the
ability to the old value. So if you lower strength from five to four, you
receive five CCP.

## Your Character

Your character starts with five in all ability scores. You may then use your
CCP to adjust these scores to roughly define your character. Notice that scores
under three and above seven are prohibited - unless your game master rules
otherwise.

# Secondary Abilities

Apart from the primary abilities, your character also has a set of secondary
abilities. These derive from your the ones above, and also change accordingly
as they increase or are lowered.

## Hit Points

Hit Points (HP) are an abstraction of your characters physical well being and
remaining health. As your character takes damage he or she loses hit points.
If your character reaches the negative value of your maximum hit points your
character is dead. Below zero hit points your character is usually negatively
impacted, or even unconscious.

A character's hit points are calculated by adding the ranks of constitution and
strength to 25.
HP = <span data-bracket-bottom="base">25</span> <span data-bracket-top="rank">+ CON</span> <span data-bracket-bottom="rank">+ STR</span>


## Speed

Speed is the amount of movement your character can do as part of action. It
is derived by adding the dexterity and strength modifier together and then add
five. A character with zero speed points left is unable to move unless he
applies effort.

## Effort

Effort a pool the represents how much additional effort a character can put into
tasks and skill checks. Applying effort means going above and beyond what the
character is usually capable of doing, usually by pushing him or her to the
limit. It is determined by adding the modifier of strength and constitution
together and multiplying them by two. This value is then added to the base of
ten.

Whenever you do a skill check, do movement using speed or try to damage someone
in melee you can spend effort to boost that skill.

## Carrying Capacity

The maximum weight a character can carry for a longer period of time is defined
by adding the character's constitution and strength rank to 10. The result is
the amount of kgs the character carry around with him.

# Pick a Background

In Endless Horizons your character learns skills that define what he or she is
good at. Backgrounds are just a set of predefined skills that fit to a certain
theme, education or training your character could have received. They are
optional, however, and experienced players might wish to pick skills for their
character individually.

Backgrounds are designed to help you get started with creating your character,
but shouldn't limit you in the possibilities. If you feel that none of the
backgrounds fit, and you do not wish to pick the skills on your own you should
talk to your game master. A game master can create new backgrounds for you.

A background usually comes with an ability increase. This increase stacks with
your changes in abilities you made already. A background also comes with
several skills unlocked and raised to certain ranks.

You are free to select more tan one background, but neither the skills nor the
ability increases stack with each other. Only the highest one applies.

# Pick Skills

Each skill your character wishes to learn has to be unlocked. Unlocking costs
one, for normal skills, and then CCP for special skills. Special skills
take longer to learn than other skills, or even require special training,
teachers or a training facility. For example studying medicine takes years,
and being a decent pilot requires training on a simulator for months.
