# Firearms

This section lists all available firearms. Each firearm uses a magazine to feed
(be it internally or externally detachable) and fires some sort of cartridge.
Different firearms use different calibres, and for each calibre different
ammunition is available. Most of the time these are normal, hollow point (for
increased effectiveness non-armoured targets) and armour piercing (for more
damage against armour.

If a firearm is not listed in the section and your players wishes to use it,
just add them. This list is not exhaustive for the massive amounts of available
firearms in the world today.

## Magazines

Many modern firearms (especially handguns, rifles) come with detachable box
magazines. These are most commonly not interchangeable between firearms unless
explicitly noted. Many firearms also come with internal magazines, for example
many pump action shotguns come with an internal magazine. Another good example
are revolvers.

Magazines are cheap to come by, and usually cost a tenth of the firearm they
belong to.

It is up to the player to manage, reload and maintain his magazines. It is not
possible to reload a magazine during combat but if spare bullets are available
magazines can be reloaded during downtime (travel with a shuttle etc.).

## Firing Modes

Most fire arms are single action (meaning one trigger pull fires one bullet).
But many also come with burst (one trigger pull fires multiple bullets) or
even fully automatic. The modes that are available depends on the firearm or
even sometimes on the model of a specific firearm.

The table lists modes with abbreviations. *S* stands for single shot,
*B* stands for burst (three round burst unless otherwise noted), *A*
stands for automatic, and *R* stands for repeating, meaning that a
mechanism has to be operated to cycle the next round into the chamber.

## Cartridges

Each firearm fires a certain calibre. The bullet defines the damage that is
done, while the firearm describes additional characteristics such as effective
range, fire-modes and more. Many cartridges come in different variations, such
as normal, sub sonic, tracer; and may come with different bullets (hollow
point, armour penetrating steel tip). Down below is a list of cartridges that
are currently available in _Endless Horizons_.

Each bullet deals piercing and bludgeoning damage to a target. The piercing
damage represents the wound canal, and the bludgeoning damage represents the
kinetic energy transfer to internal organs and tissue.

The cost and weight is for the given amounts of rounds.

## Pistols

Pistols (or handguns) are compact weapons usually used in close quarter combat.
While most armed forces use them as secondary weapons (alongside more powerful
rifles) many civilians or contractors rely on them mainly for their security
and defence.

Most pistols are semi automatic, feeding from a detachable box magazine.

The weight is given unloaded.

## Shotguns

Most shotguns are of the pump-action variety and come with an internal tube that
holds a fixed amount of ammunition. The TOZ-34 is a stand in for most break-top
shotguns (regardless of many barrels they have). There are simply too many to
list them all.

## Submachine Guns

Submachine guns fire a pistol calibre, often very concealable, and deadly in
close quarters. They are often issued to support personnel, vehicle operators
and security detail that need a compact but deadly and efficient weapon.

## Rifles

Rifles range from combat rifles, assault rifles to bolt action rifles. Almost
all armies use one as their main infantry weapon. They are the go to fire arm
for most skirmishes and encounters.

The AN-94 comes with a special burst, where the effective recoil of the weapon
is 1 for the second bullet in burst.

The AS Val comes with an integrated silencer. If removed, the gun will not
cycle anymore and loose half of its effective range.

## Machine Guns

Light machine guns offer a big magazine capacity (often fed from a belt) and
capability for long sustained fire. While carrying and firing from the shoulder
is possible, they are far more effective when fired from a bi-pod or when mounted
on a swivel.

Most belt fed machine guns feed from a chain, which either disintegrates after
being fired or not. If it doesn't disintegrate it can be refilled.
