# Apparel

## Slots

Clothing, apparel, carriers and other utilities that are worn on the body
provide _slots_. Slots are used to wear equipment directly on the body
for easy access. Slots could be pockets on trousers or jackets, or holsters that
are carried on a belt.

There are three types of slots:

- _Armour slots_: They provide a possibility to insert protective plating
(see below for list of available armour plates).
- _Fast access slots_ or _FA slots_ are slots that are meant to be
accessed quickly by the wearer. Pouches on a chest carrier or holsters usually
come with a few _FA slots_ to allow for fast access to guns, ammunition
or other useful items. Accessing a _FA slot_ takes a swift action.
- _Misc. slots_ are slots that can store equipment but are not as easily
accessed as _FA slots_. Accessing them takes a normal action. Examples
for _misc. slots_ are pockets on trousers or jackets.

Accessing other items (for example in a bag or backpack) usually takes two
actions or longer.

## Clothing

Normal clothing is usually not listed in this chapter. It is deemed as
too unimportant to list prices or weight. They are readily available
in most stores for little money (ranging from two to ten credits).

However, both pants and jackets provide misc slots. Pants are considered to
provide 2 _misc. slots_, and jackets usually also provide 2 _misc. slots_.

A special case are leather holsters or belts, which provide one 1 _fast access
slot_ and 2 _misc. slots_.

## Body Armour

Body armour comes in many different shapes and sizes. The most common are
metal plates that are inserted into what is called a "chest carrier". These
plates then stop the bullets from entering and absorb the force of the bullet.
The armour usually covers the most vital part of body (i.e. the chest and
back) and come with a specific rating. If a specified calibre is stopped by
the armour the target takes no damage. The damage is absorbed by the armour
instead. Yet if the armour reaches zero hit points it stops being
effective. If the bullet is not stopped by the armour, both the armour and the
target being hit take equal amounts of damage.

Armour is classified into various _tiers_ determining what kinds of threats
it stops. Please see the calibres to see what kind of armour tier a specific
calibre penetrates. All armour is capable of defending a player from slashing
damage from knives and other small blades or thrown weapons.

All plates require a carrier. The kevlar vest has protection for both front
and back (each for 40 hit points) and cannot be worn in combination with a
chest carrier, except for the FREJ MK I tactical vest (see below). You also
cannot carry more than one tactical vest, plate carrier or kevlar armour on
the torso at the same time.

| Armour          | Class | HP  | Cost | Weight | Notes |
| --------------- | ----- | --- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Kevlar Vest     | I     | 20  | 100  | 2.0kg  |       |
| Plate Class I   | I     | 30  | 100  | 1.5kg  |       |
| Plate Class II  | II    | 40  | 150  | 2.0kg  |       |
| Plate Class III | III   | 50  | 250  | 3.0kg  |       |
| Plate Class IV  | IV    | 60  | 350  | 3.5kg  |       |
| Plate Class V   | V     | 70  | 450  | 3.8kg  |       |
| Plate Class VI  | VI    | 80  | 550  | 4.3kg  |       |

## Chest Carries

The most commonly used armour is a plate and chest carrier with armour plates
inserted. The carrier has slots for usually several armour plates and comes
with pouches where the player can quickly access certain gear (such as
magazines, grenades and other useful items). The first armour slot is for the
front, the second armour slot protects the back, and the third protects the
wearer's left and the fourth the wearer's right side of the torso. Plates for
the wearer's left and right torso weigh and cost only half but also absorb only
half the amount of damage.

The slots can be filled with various accessories, while the armour slots are
for armour plates.

The weight is given unloaded.

## Suits

Suits are whole-body garment that protects against hazardous materials, and
always come with a self-contained breathing apparatus. They're used when dealing
with hazardous environments or in a vacuum (such as space).

All suits come with head lamps, magnetic boots, an integrated radio for
communications and a head camera. The head camera transmits the field of view
from the helmet to a designated target (usually HQ, combat station on a ship or
the pilot).

All suits come with a variable amount of internal air storage, and a variable
amount of power supply. See the table for further details. The battery can be
switched out during normal operation or recharged at most standard wall power
plugs.

The suits can be switched to a mode where an external air (either from the
atmosphere, or supplied by cable from an oxygen tank) source is used.  The
internal air storage can be changed during operation, or it can be refilled at
an oxygen station (but not through the atmosphere, as compressed air is needed).
Switching an oxygen tank on a suit takes two actions. One action to remove, and
one to insert a new one. A suit without an oxygen tank has roughly 30 seconds of
air.

The air and power field determine how many hours this suit provides air, and
power to its systems before they need recharging. A suit without power loses all
systems (such as camera, head lamps and mag boots).

Some suits come with night-vision (NV) or thermal imaging (TI) or even with
small manoeuvrable thrusters (MT) for micro gravity navigation.

The hazard rating reduces incoming hazard damage (such as fire, acid or
radiation), and all suites are rated for environments between -100 degrees
celcius and +100 degrees celcius. The protection against cold and heat requires
working power, and if power is lost, the suit gives normal protection against
cold and heat (between -20 degrees and +40 degrees).
