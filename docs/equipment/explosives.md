# Explosives

## Grenades

This section covers hand thrown grenades (hand grenades). The table specifies
their effective range (the distance an average person is capable of throwing
them), their cost and damage. Fragmentation grenades have a _kill radius_
of five metres (5m) in which any unprotected target is effectively killed, and
a _casualty range_ of 15 metres in which targets are damaged enough to
render them harmless. Below 15 metres the grenade does normal damage, and
beyond that range it does half. If sturdy enough cover is available remove
the piercing damage, as it represents the flying shrapnel.

Most hand grenades come with a pin that has to be pulled in order to arm the
grenade. Once thrown the lever detaches lighting the fuse. Most fuses range
between four and six seconds.

| Name       | Damage                       | Cost | Weight | Range |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| F1 Grenade | 6d6 piercing/6d6 bludgeoning | 250  | 0.6kg  | 30m   |
| M67        | 6d6 piercing/6d6 bludgeoning | 250  | 0.8kg  | 30m   |

## Nonlethal Grenades

This section covers non lethal grenades. They also have an effective range
of about 30 metres.

Smoke grenades come in different colours (although most are white) and can be
used to block line of sight. Only FLIR (thermal imaging) is capable of seeing
heat signatures through smoke.

Stun grenades temporarily blind, deafen and disorient a target for 2d4
actions.

| Name               | Note                                                  | Cost | Weight | Range |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Stun grenade       | Applies _blinded_ and _deafened_ for 2d4 actions.     | 300  | 0.7kg  | 30m   |
| Smoke grenade      | Blocks line of sight, except thermal imaging.         | 200  | 0.5kg  | 30m   |
| Sting ball grenade | Applies _stunned_ for 2d4 actions.                    | 300  | 0.8kg  | 30m   |

## Anti Vehicle Weapons

The table below shows a list of man portable anti vehicle weapons. These are
intended to be used against small armoured vehicles (such as tanks, armored
trucks and cars, helicopters or small landing craft). Many of these vary in
shape, size and cost; but most importantly in how they function.

Some are single use only, and are discarded after use, while others can be
reloaded. The ammunition used also differs from weapon to weapon. The most
expensive launcher can fire different kind of ammuntion, for example guided
missiles and rockets. Others just shoot unguided dumb fire rockets or rocket
propelled grenades.

While these weapons are mostly used to destroy or disable enemy armour, they
can also be used to destroy houses or fortification.

Some of these weapons require careful handling as they could be potentially
dangerous to one owns health if used improperly. Some have a considerable and
dangerous back blast that could kill anyone standing behind the shooter when the
weapon is fired. The lethal range of such a _backblast_ is usually given in
metres. Beyound that range anyone caught with the back blast takes _2d6_
force and _2d6_ fire damage up until double the _backblast_ range.
Weapons with a _backblast_ are safe to fire from enclosed spaces as long
as a leeway of roughly 3 metres is given behind the shooter.

The ammunition table lists the ammunition used by the various launchers. If
used against infantry they are considered to have a _kill radius_ just like
grenades. Beyound the _kill radius_ personnel take the amount of damage given
in the table. The penetration capabilities are given in the highest possible
armour rating this round can penetrate.
