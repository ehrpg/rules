# Currency

The world of Endless Horizons knows only one currency: Credit, C for short.
Everything is payed for and with Credit.

# Melee Weapons

Below is a list of melee weapons. Most blade weapons allow for either slashing
damage or piercing damage and a player may select what he wishes to do (i.e.
slash or try stab the opponent).

| Name              | Damage | Cost  | Notes         | Weight
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- | ------------- | --------
| Knife             | 10     | 100   | Combat knife  | 0.3kg
| Sword             | 14     | 200   |               | 1.5kg
| Baton             | 10     | 150   | Deals bludgeoning damage | 0.5kg
| Throwing Knife    | 8      | 50    | Can be thrown, 20m effective range | 0.2kg
| Throwing Axe      | 8      | 50    | Can be thrown, 20m effective range | 0.2kg

Armour does protect against knife and sword slashes, and every metal plate
also stops the blade from piercing into the body. Kevlar however cannot stop
a piercing blade.
