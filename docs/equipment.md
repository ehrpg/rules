# Melee Weapons

Below is a list of melee weapons. Most blade weapons allow for either slashing
damage or piercing damage and a player may select what he wishes to do (i.e.
slash or try stab the opponent).

| Name              | Damage | Cost  | Notes         | Weight
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- | ------------- | --------
| Knife             | 2d8    | 100   | Combat knife  | 0.3kg
| Sword             | 3d8    | 200   |               | 1.5kg
| Baton             | 2d8    | 150   | Deals bludgeoning damage | 0.5kg
| Throwing Knife    | 2d6    | 50    | Can be thrown, 20m effective range | 0.2kg
| Throwing Axe      | 2d6    | 50    | Can be thrown, 20m effective range | 0.2kg

Armour does protect against knife and sword slashes, and every metal plate
also stops the blade from piercing into the body. Kevlar however cannot stop
a piercing blade.

# Firearms

This section lists all available firearms. Each firearm uses a magazine to feed
(be it internally or externally detachable) and fires some sort of cartridge.
Different firearms use different calibres, and for each calibre different
ammunition is available. Most of the time these are normal, hollow point (for
increased effectiveness non-armoured targets) and armour piercing (for more
damage against armour.

If a firearm is not listed in the section and your players wishes to use it,
just add them. This list is not exhaustive for the massive amounts of available
firearms in the world today.

## Magazines

Many modern firearms (especially handguns, rifles) come with detachable box
magazines. These are most commonly not interchangeable between firearms unless
explicitly noted. Many firearms also come with internal magazines, for example
many pump action shotguns come with an internal magazine. Another good example
are revolvers.

Magazines are cheap to come by, and usually cost a tenth of the firearm they
belong to.

It is up to the player to manage, reload and maintain his magazines. It is not
possible to reload a magazine during combat but if spare bullets are available
magazines can be reloaded during downtime (travel with a shuttle etc.).

## Firing Modes

Most fire arms are single action (meaning one trigger pull fires one bullet).
But many also come with burst (one trigger pull fires multiple bullets) or
even fully automatic. The modes that are available depends on the firearm or
even sometimes on the model of a specific firearm.

The table lists modes with abbreviations. *S* stands for single shot,
*B* stands for burst (three round burst unless otherwise noted), *A*
stands for automatic, and *R* stands for repeating, meaning that a
mechanism has to be operated to cycle the next round into the chamber.

## Cartridges

Each firearm fires a certain calibre. The bullet defines the damage that is
done, while the firearm describes additional characteristics such as effective
range, fire-modes and more. Many cartridges come in different variations, such
as normal, sub sonic, tracer; and may come with different bullets (hollow
point, armour penetrating steel tip). Down below is a list of cartridges that
are currently available in _Endless Horizons_.

Each bullet deals piercing and bludgeoning damage to a target. The piercing
damage represents the wound canal, and the bludgeoning damage represents the
kinetic energy transfer to internal organs and tissue.

The cost and weight is for the given amounts of rounds.

## Pistols

Pistols (or handguns) are compact weapons usually used in close quarter combat.
While most armed forces use them as secondary weapons (alongside more powerful
rifles) many civilians or contractors rely on them mainly for their security
and defence.

Most pistols are semi automatic, feeding from a detachable box magazine.

The weight is given unloaded.

## Shotguns

Most shotguns are of the pump-action variety and come with an internal tube that
holds a fixed amount of ammunition. The TOZ-34 is a stand in for most break-top
shotguns (regardless of many barrels they have). There are simply too many to
list them all.

## Submachine Guns

Submachine guns fire a pistol calibre, often very concealable, and deadly in
close quarters. They are often issued to support personnel, vehicle operators
and security detail that need a compact but deadly and efficient weapon.

## Rifles

Rifles range from combat rifles, assault rifles to bolt action rifles. Almost
all armies use one as their main infantry weapon. They are the go to fire arm
for most skirmishes and encounters.

The AN-94 comes with a special burst, where the effective recoil of the weapon
is 1 for the second bullet in burst.

The AS Val comes with an integrated silencer. If removed, the gun will not
cycle anymore and loose half of its effective range.

## Machine Guns

Light machine guns offer a big magazine capacity (often fed from a belt) and
capability for long sustained fire. While carrying and firing from the shoulder
is possible, they are far more effective when fired from a bi-pod or when mounted
on a swivel.

Most belt fed machine guns feed from a chain, which either disintegrates after
being fired or not. If it doesn't disintegrate it can be refilled.

# Apparel

## Slots

Clothing, apparel, carriers and other utilities that are worn on the body
provide _slots_. Slots are used to wear equipment directly on the body
for easy access. Slots could be pockets on trousers or jackets, or holsters that
are carried on a belt.

There are three types of slots:

- _Armour slots_: They provide a possibility to insert protective plating
(see below for list of available armour plates).
- _Fast access slots_ or _FA slots_ are slots that are meant to be
accessed quickly by the wearer. Pouches on a chest carrier or holsters usually
come with a few _FA slots_ to allow for fast access to guns, ammunition
or other useful items. Accessing a _FA slot_ takes a swift action.
- _Misc. slots_ are slots that can store equipment but are not as easily
accessed as _FA slots_. Accessing them takes a normal action. Examples
for _misc. slots_ are pockets on trousers or jackets.

Accessing other items (for example in a bag or backpack) usually takes two
actions or longer.

## Clothing

Normal clothing is usually not listed in this chapter. It is deemed as
too unimportant to list prices or weight. They are readily available
in most stores for little money (ranging from two to ten credits).

However, both pants and jackets provide misc slots. Pants are considered to
provide 2 _misc. slots_, and jackets usually also provide 2 _misc. slots_.

A special case are leather holsters or belts, which provide one 1 _fast access
slot_ and 2 _misc. slots_.

## Body Armour

Body armour comes in many different shapes and sizes. The most common are metal
plates that are inserted into what is called a "chest carrier". These plates
then stop the bullets from entering and absorb some of the force of the bullet.
The armour usually covers the most vital part of body (i.e. the chest and back)
and come with a specific rating. If a specified calibre is stopped by the
armour the target takes only half the bludgeoning damage instead. The rest of
the damage is absorbed by the armour. Yet if the armour reaches zero hit points
it stops being effective. If the bullet is not stopped by armour, both the
armour and person being hit take equal amounts of damage.

Armour is classified into various _tiers_ determining what kinds of threats
it stops. Please see the calibres to see what kind of armour tier a specific
calibre penetrates. All armour is capable of defending a player from slashing
damage from knives and other small blades or thrown weapons.

All plates require a carrier. The kevlar vest has protection for both front
and back (both for 40 hit points) and cannot be worn in combination with a
chest carrier, except for the FREJ MK I tactical vest (see below). You also
cannot carry more than one tactical vest, plate carrier or kevlar armour on
the torso at the same time.

| Armour          | Class | HP  | Cost | Weight | Notes |
| --------------- | ----- | --- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Kevlar Vest     | I     | 20  | 100  | 2.0kg  |       |
| Plate Class I   | I     | 30  | 100  | 1.5kg  |       |
| Plate Class II  | II    | 40  | 150  | 2.0kg  |       |
| Plate Class III | III   | 50  | 250  | 3.0kg  |       |
| Plate Class IV  | IV    | 60  | 350  | 3.5kg  |       |
| Plate Class V   | V     | 70  | 450  | 3.8kg  |       |
| Plate Class VI  | VI    | 80  | 550  | 4.3kg  |       |

## Chest Carries

The most commonly used armour is a plate and chest carrier with armour plates
inserted. The carrier has slots for usually several armour plates and comes
with pouches where the player can quickly access certain gear (such as
magazines, grenades and other useful items). The first armour slot is for the
front, the second armour slot protects the back, and the third protects the
wearer's left and the fourth the wearer's right side of the torso. Plates for
the wearer's left and right torso weigh and cost only half but also absorb only
half the amount of damage.

The slots can be filled with various accessories, while the armour slots are
for armour plates.

The weight is given unloaded.

| Name       | Armour Slots | FA Slots | Cost | Weight | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| FREJ MK I  | 0            | 4        | 200  | 0.4kg  |       |
| FREJ MK II | 1            | 6        | 400  | 0.6kg  |       |
| THOR MK I  | 2            | 8        | 900  | 1.0kg  |       |
| THOR MK II | 4            | 12       | 1200 | 1.2kg  |       |

## Suits

Suits are whole-body garment that protects against hazardous materials, and
always come with a self-contained breathing apparatus. They're used when dealing
with hazardous environments or in a vacuum (such as space).

All suits come with head lamps, magnetic boots, an integrated radio for
communications and a head camera. The head camera transmits the field of view
from the helmet to a designated target (usually HQ, combat station on a ship or
the pilot).

All suits come with a variable amount of internal air storage, and a variable
amount of power supply. See the table for further details. The battery can be
switched out during normal operation or recharged at most standard wall power
plugs.

The suits can be switched to a mode where an external air (either from the
atmosphere, or supplied by cable from an oxygen tank) source is used.  The
internal air storage can be changed during operation, or it can be refilled at
an oxygen station (but not through the atmosphere, as compressed air is needed).
Switching an oxygen tank on a suit takes two actions. One action to remove, and
one to insert a new one. A suit without an oxygen tank has roughly 30 seconds of
air.

The air and power field determine how many hours this suit provides air, and
power to its systems before they need recharging. A suit without power loses all
systems (such as camera, head lamps and mag boots).

Some suits come with night-vision (NV) or thermal imaging (TI) or even with
small manoeuvrable thrusters (MT) for micro gravity navigation.

# Explosives

## Grenades

This section covers hand thrown grenades (hand grenades). The table specifies
their effective range (the distance an average person is capable of throwing
them), their cost and damage. Fragmentation grenades have a _kill radius_
of five metres (5m) in which any unprotected target is effectively killed, and
a _casualty range_ of 15 metres in which targets are damaged enough to
render them harmless. Below 15 metres the grenade does normal damage, and
beyond that range it does half. If sturdy enough cover is available remove
the piercing damage, as it represents the flying shrapnel.

Most hand grenades come with a pin that has to be pulled in order to arm the
grenade. Once thrown the lever detaches lighting the fuse. Most fuses range
between four and six seconds.

| Name       | Damage                       | Cost | Weight | Range |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| F1 Grenade | 6d6 piercing/6d6 bludgeoning | 250  | 0.6kg  | 30m   |
| M67        | 6d6 piercing/6d6 bludgeoning | 250  | 0.8kg  | 30m   |

## Nonlethal Grenades

This section covers non lethal grenades. They also have an effective range
of about 30 metres.

Smoke grenades come in different colours (although most are white) and can be
used to block line of sight. Only FLIR (thermal imaging) is capable of seeing
heat signatures through smoke.

Stun grenades temporarily blind, deafen and disorient a target for 2d4
actions.

| Name               | Note                                                  | Cost | Weight | Range |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Stun grenade       | Applies _blinded_ and _deafened_ for 2d4 actions.     | 300  | 0.7kg  | 30m   |
| Smoke grenade      | Blocks line of sight, except thermal imaging.         | 200  | 0.5kg  | 30m   |
| Sting ball grenade | Applies _stunned_ for 2d4 actions.                    | 300  | 0.8kg  | 30m   |

## Anti Vehicle Weapons

The table below shows a list of man portable anti vehicle weapons. These are
intended to be used against small armoured vehicles (such as tanks, armored
trucks and cars, helicopters or small landing craft). Many of these vary in
shape, size and cost; but most importantly in how they function.

Some are single use only, and are discarded after use, while others can be
reloaded. The ammunition used also differs from weapon to weapon. The most
expensive launcher can fire different kind of ammuntion, for example guided
missiles and rockets. Others just shoot unguided dumb fire rockets or rocket
propelled grenades.

While these weapons are mostly used to destroy or disable enemy armour, they
can also be used to destroy houses or fortification.

Some of these weapons require careful handling as they could be potentially
dangerous to one owns health if used improperly. Some have a considerable and
dangerous back blast that could kill anyone standing behind the shooter when the
weapon is fired. The lethal range of such a _backblast_ is usually given in
metres. Beyound that range anyone caught with the back blast takes _2d6_
force and _2d6_ fire damage up until double the _backblast_ range.
Weapons with a _backblast_ are safe to fire from enclosed spaces as long
as a leeway of roughly 3 metres is given behind the shooter.

The ammunition table lists the ammunition used by the various launchers. If
used against infantry they are considered to have a _kill radius_ just like
grenades. Beyound the _kill radius_ personnel take the amount of damage given
in the table. The penetration capabilities are given in the highest possible
armour rating this round can penetrate.

| Name   | Cost | Weight | Range | Recoil | Notes                     |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ----- | ------ | ------------------------- |
