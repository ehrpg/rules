# Thrown Weapons

Thrown weapons (throwing knives, axes and hand grenades) are handled just like
other ranged weapons, except that a different skill is used in the checks:
_Throwing_. Thrown weapons also have an _effective range_ and cause
damage just like a bullet from a firearm would.

## Grenades

Throwing a grenade at a specific area (for example next or behind a cover) is
usually considered a range task with a _medium_ target (the area). Any special
circumstances might reduce or widen the size. For example throwing a grenade
into a window would cause the target to be _small_ (for a small window), or
casting a grenade into a small man-hole might even be considered a _tiny_
target.

Most hand held explosive grenades have what is called an _effective_ and an
_casualty_ radius. Everyone within the _effective_ radius, that is not
protected by grenade proof cover, dies. Within the _casualty_ radius a grenade
deals enough damage to kill or incapacitate all of the targets.

Grenades cause two types of damage: _bludgeoning_ from the explosive shock
wave, and piercing _piercing_ from the flying shrapnel. Due to the massive
amounts of shrapnel only full cover or full body armour can protect against
the piercing damage.
