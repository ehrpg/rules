# Melee Combat

A player character can engage another in melee combat if they are close to each
other (up to a metre). To attack another opponent in melee roll a skill check
of the _Melee Combat_ skill. If it counts as a _surprise attack_ the
opponent is not allowed to dodge or block and must take the attack. If attacker
hits, he rolls for damage. See the equipment section for weapons and their
damage.

If the opponent is aware of the attack he may now use one of his actions this
round to dodge the attack. If he has no more actions left, he can dodge but
takes a cumulative penalty of -2 for each additional dodge. To dodge the
attack the opponent makes a _Dodge_ check against the attacker's attack
check. If the defender exceeds the attack roll he has successfully evaded the
attack and takes no damage.

Instead of dodging an attack, one may also choose to _block_ instead. The
opponent rolls a ten sided die (d10) and adds _Strength_ and _Constitution_
modifiers to the dice result. If he exceeds the attack roll, he has
successfully blocked the attack, and damage received is halved. Otherwise the
damage is taken in full.
