# Damage

The weapon used always determines the amount and type of damage that can be
caused to another. A knife for example can deal piercing or slashing damage
depending how it's being used. A firearm usually causes piercing and
bludgeoning damage. Hits with bare fists may just cause bludgeoning damage.

Other forms of damage are of course also possible, for example a player can
take fire damage from an open flame, or acid damage from being exposed to
acids or other corrosive fluids.

## Zones

When a player hits another, either with a ranged or melee weapon, the attacking
player rolls two six sided die (2d6) to determine where he scores a hit.

The target then determines if he has clothing or armor that protects him in this
region and substracts any relevant damage reductions from the incoming damage.
If any damage is left the target resolves any effects of the target area (for
example damage multiplier) and substracts that number from his hit points.

If the target survives it, he then has to roll another check to see if the
injury causes a wound. See the chapter _Injury and Death_ regarding rules
for wounds.

Aiming for a specific zone is possible. The size modifier of the target is
reduced one step any body part except the vital organs, and by two steps for
vital organs. If the reduction is not possible because the size modifier would
be beneath "tiny" then aiming at it the zone specifically is not possible. If
the attack succeeds the zone is hit automatically without a need to roll the two
six sided dices.

The following is a hit zone for a human or human-like creature:

| Result | Zone         | Effect
|--------|--------------|---------------
| 2      | Vital Organ  | Special, Damage * 6
| 3,4    | Legs         |
| 5,6,7  | Torso        | Damage * 2
| 8,9    | Arms         |
| 10, 11 | Head         | Damage * 3
| 12     | Vital Organ  | Special, Damage * 6

## Vital Organs

Most creatures, animals (including humans) have vital organs. Any damage
to those areas is usually fatal. For humans these areas would be the brain
and the heart. Damage to the vital organs follows special rules, usually
depending on the creature involved. However if - after applying these special
rules - any damage is done to the vital organ this damage is multiplied by
six (6).

### Humans

Humans have two vital organs: The _heart_ and the _brain_. Both the brain and
the heart are usually protected either by the skull or the rib cage. Any
bludgeoning damage below _ten_ (10) is automatically converted into a hit
towards the surrounding hit zone (torso for heart, and head for
brain). Slashing damage cannot harm either of those vital two organs unless
they are exposed. Any piercing damage above _two_ (2) can easily penetrate the
rib cage or skull and does full damage. Any piercing damage below _two_ is
stopped by the bone and negated.
