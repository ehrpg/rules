# Ranged Combat

Ranged combat works differently. A player chooses to engage another in ranged
combat, takes aim and fires. The player who is being targeted has no chance
usually has little change to evade (except on extreme distances). The difficulty
of landing a successful hit depends on several factors:

- Size: The difficulty increases if the target is smaller or decreases if the
target is bigger.
- Range: Depending on the weapon in question, targets get harder to hit at
longer ranges.
- Stances: Various stances can decrease the difficulty. A person firing a
fully automatic rifle while standing, has a low chance of hitting than a
person who fires single shots from the prone position.
- Movement: A moving target is hard to hit, especially at further ranges. This
also applies if the shooter is moving while trying to aim.
- Environmental: Darkness, strong winds and impaired vision can all affect on how
well a character can hit a target.

The game master calculates the difficulty of the task depending on these factors
and player rolls an appropriate skill check. If he reaches it or exceeds the
difficulty he scores a hit.

## Cover

The best way to protect oneself from fire is to hide beneath or behind cover.
Depending on the material of the cover bullets may still be able to penetrate
the cover and cause damage to the people behind the cover.

For example most bullets can penetrate a wooden cover, whereas a .50 BMG is even
capable of tearing through brick walls.

## Size

The game separates targets into size categories. An average human standing is
considered a _medium_ target. The same average human that is either sitting on
the floor or kneeling is considered a _small_ target. The same person in the
prone position is considered _tiny_. These size categories do not change
depending on the distance from the shooter. They just help to categorize the
targets. For example a big dog would be considered a _small_ target, while a
sneaking would count as _tiny_.

Targets larger than a human also have their own size categories. A car, for
example is considered a _large_ target. So are some other vehicles that fit
roughly the same size. Bigger targets are considered _huge_, for example large
vehicles (main battle tanks, MRAPs, IVFs) or even space ships.

## Range

The range to a target is always given rough estimate in metres. The game master
should avoid making a science of it, and should operate in rough estimates.

The gun play mechanics then categorize these ranges into what is called an
_effective range_. This is a metric used in conjunction
with firearms to determine how effective they are at certain ranges. The authors
know that firearms are more complicated than that, and much of it depends on the
skill of the shooter involved. Still this metric is used for abstraction and for
balancing reasons.

The _effective range_ is broadly defined as the distance an average shooter
should be able to hit a _medium_ target half of the time. Other ranges are
derived from this in fractions:

- _Maximum_: Between _effective range_ and half the _effective range_.
- _Far_: Between _maximum_ and a quarter of the _effective range_.
- _Medium_: Between _far_ and an eights of the _effective range_.
- _Close_: Below an eights of the _effective range_.

For example, let's assume a Glock 17 has an effective range of 50 metres. The
ranges are thus as following: _Maximum_ is between 50 and 25 metres. _Far_
between 25 and 12.5 metres. _Medium_ between 12.5 metres and six metres, and
_close_ is everything closer than six metres.

The size category of the target and the range category are combined and lead
to the following table of penalties for the difficulty task:

| Size    | Close | Medium | Far | Maximum
|---------|-------|--------|-----|--------
| Tiny    | +3    | +6     | +12 | +18
| Small   | +2    | +4     | +8  | +12
| Medium  | +1    | +2     | +4  | +6
| Large   | -12   | -8     | -4  | -2
| Huge    | -18   | -12    | -6  | -3

## Movement

Movement is also categorized into four categories: _still_, _subtle_, _slow_
and _fast_. A normal human being standing is considered moving _subtly_ as no
person normally stands perfectly still. Objects may as well stand perfectly
_still_, as in their movement is not noticeable. So do living beings who are
perhaps bound, unconscious or otherwise incapable of moving. _Slow_ movement
incorporates anything at the speed of an average human walking. _Fast_ is
anything that moves at a speed of an average human sprinting or above.

The penalties are as followed:

| Still | Subtle | Slow | Fast |
|-------|--------|------|------|
| -2    | 0      | +2   | +4   |

These penalties apply for both a moving target, and a shooter that is moving. So
a player who is running and shooting at a target that is also running as a
cumulative penalty of plus eight (+8).

## Stance

A person firing can be in one of the following firing stances: _standing_,
_kneeling_, _prone firing_, and _prone_. Standing also makes the person in
question a medium target, _kneeling_ makes him a small and _prone_ and
_prone firing_ a tiny target.

The difference between _prone_ and _prone firing_ is that a prone firing is an
actual rifle stance. The prone firing position gives an aiming advantage,
while prone does not. If a person falls on the floor, or is knocked down he is
considered _prone_ instead of being in the _prone firing_ position.

The penalties for the stances are as followed:

| Stance       | Penalty |
|--------------|---------|
| Standing     | -1
| Kneeling     | -2
| Prone firing | -3
| Prone        | +2

## Taking Aim

A character is always considered to at least raise is weapon, aim shortly and
the fire by default.

But a character may expend an action to take careful aim. The difficulty is
reduced by two (2) for each action he chooses to take aim for. The bonus is lost
if he doesn't fire in the same round he also take aim for.

## Bursts and Full Auto

Each weapon which is capable of burst firing or fully automatic has a recoil
modifier. Each subsequent bullet adds this recoil modifier to the difficulty.
Regardless only one attack roll is made for the burst. As many bullets of the
burst hit as the attack roll meets or exceeds in difficulty. While the
progression is linear (per bullet) in a real life scenario it is perfectly
reasonable for the first bullet to hit, the second to miss and the third to
hit again.

Example: A player wishes to shoot a three round burst at a target. The
difficulty is determined to be 16 and the recoil modifier of the gun is 2.
The player rolls a 19. This means that the first bullet (difficulty 16) hits,
the second does as well (as the player's 19 is above 16 plus 2) but the third
bullet does not (19 is below 20).

## Suppressing Fire

Sometimes it is necessary to keep the enemy sitting ducks. Usually to allow
someone else to flank around, or to cover the get away of others. With
suppressing fire you have to fire a certain amount bullets towards the
enemies you wish to suppress for each action you wish to suppress them. This
includes your actions, those of your allies and the actions of the enemy. The
amount of bullets required is determined by the game master. Depending on the
situation. The game master may even allow you to fire and aim at an enemy out of
turn if they leave their cover while you suppress them.

If you run out of bullets and have to reload you have to await your turn to
reload and the suppression ends.

The game master has to determine the bullets required. For example, covering a
simple narrow corridor (with enemies left and right of the door) usually
requires just one bullets per action. While a wide open area with natural
cover and enemies advancing may require a short burst per cover.

The rule of thumb is, that one shooter with one bullet per action can
effectively suppress one lane of attack (i.e. one hallway, one street). If
the area is wide and open, a small burst (of three to five bullets) is usually
required to keep one group of advancing enemies at bay.

Despite common misconception it is not required to fire full auto to achieve
a suppression effect. If a sharp shooter covers a narrow side alley and takes
single shots at anyone who wishes to cross, the enemies will still think twice
before crossing.

## Reloading

Reloading a firearms takes a certain amount of actions. If not otherwise noted
in the description of the firearm, it takes one action to reload the firearm.

If the firearm uses magazines, that means swapping the empty magazine for a new
one and cocking the gun. Reloading magazines themselves is generally not
possible during a firefight.

## Drawing

Drawing a pistol or a knife from a holster takes one action. The same applies
if you carry the pistol or knife conceiled on your body (but still using a
holster). The same applies if you carry the knife or the pistol in a slot of
a body armor.

If the weapon is not in a slot of an armor, or in a holster (i.e. hidden in
a boot, in your pocket, a rucksack or shouldered) it takes two actions to
draw the weapon.

## Hiding

You can hide small weapons (Pistols, PDWs) on your body. This is not the same
as doing conceiled carry. Use your _stealth_ skill to hide the weapon on
your body. Anybody searching you must use an apposing _notice_ check to
find the hidden weapon on you, but gains a -5 on his difficulty task, as finding
a weapon is easier than hiding one. If someone wishes to determine from a
distance if you are armed or not, he must also make a _notice_ check, but does
not gain any benefit.

## Malfunctions

Firearms are mechanical devices that can fail. Wear and tear, or inproper
cleaning and handling can contribute to these malfunctions or stoppages. There
are variety of possible malfunctions, ranging from temporary to relative save
malfunctions to potentially dangerous ones that can permanently damage the gun
or cause injury or death.

These malfunctions are candidates for minor or medium negative effects.

A minor fault is a _failure to feed_ (FTF) when the firearm fails to feed
the next cartridge into the chamber from a magazine. It can also be caused by
not holding the fire arm properly (``limp wristing''). It can usually be cleared
in one action and does not immediately threaten the shooter. It does however
stop a burst or fully automatic fire.

A stovepipe (_failure to eject_) occours when the spent casing is not
properly ejected from the firearm, causing it to jam the ejection port. It
presents no immediate danger to the shooter and can be cleared in one action. It
does however stop a burst or fully automatic fire.

A severe major fault is a so called _squib load_ where the projectile does
not have enough force to exit the barrel and becomes stuck. A subsequent bullet
fired afterwards can cause catastrophic failure, causing damage to the firearm
and injury to the shooter.

## Determining Difficulty

The base difficulty for ranged attacks is five (5). Then you combine the size
category and the range category and add it. Then you add a movement penalty,
if the target is moving or the shooter is moving. Then you add stance modifiers,
any environmental modifiers and any miscellaneous modifiers.

_Example_: A player wishes to fire a three round burst with his rifle
(recoil modifier of 2) (range 300 metres) at a small target roughly 100 metres
out. It is dusk and the game master decides that he has an additional penalty
of +2 for from low light conditions. The player as a dexterity and perception
modifier of +1, and three ranks in the appropriate skill. The difficulty is
determined as following:


<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
DC = <span data-bracket-bottom="base">5</span>
<span data-bracket-top="range">+ 8</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="low light">+ 1</span>
<span data-bracket-top="stance">- 1</span>
= 13
</div>

The player rolls the following:

<div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
1d10 = <span data-bracket-bottom="roll">8</span>
<span data-bracket-top="dexterity">+ 1</span>
<span data-bracket-bottom="perception">+ 1</span>
<span data-bracket-top="skill">+ 3</span>
= 13
</div>

And scores one hit. The other two of his bullets miss.
