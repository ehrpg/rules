Everything in Endless Horizons is done by making a _check_ against a given
_difficulty_. It is the player's job to make the check, while it is the game
masters job to keep track of the difficulty. When bonuses or penalties are given
in this document, they usually apply to the difficulty and _not the check_ that
the player makes.

This is important as the player probably does not, and should not, know all the
factors that make his work harder or easier. As a game master you should always
be as transparent as possible, when it comes to determining the difficulty.

## Difficulty

The difficulty (or DC) always ranges from 1 to 10. With 1 being so
easy that a roll is not required, and ten being almost impossible.
The game rules provide no bonuses in addition to the dice result of
the player, so a ten will always be almost impossible. The only
advantage the player gets are additional dices (through skills or
circumstance).

Most of the game rules give the DM hints on how to design his
difficulties. These are just hints, and DM is always free to just
make up the DC on the fly.

## Rolling

All checks are made by rolling one or more ten sided dice (1d10). The
amount of dice the player may roll depends on his rank in the given
skill. If at least one of the rolled dice meet or exceed the
difficulty set forth by the DM the check is successfull. A dice that
meets the difficulty is called a success, and dice that fails to
meet the difficulty is called a failure.

If the player has additional dice he might roll more than one
success. These may be used to by the player to do additional
tasks related to the same skill in one action, or it could be
used by DM to grant additional bonuses to the player.

## Contests

When two players, or a player and an NPC, use their skills against
each other, they are rolling in a contest.

The person initaiting rolls all his available dices and keeps the
highest. The person in the passive position then rolls all his dice
attempting to beat the highest roll of the initiator. In case of a
tie the passive side wins.

Should either side have a clear advantage over the other, the DM may
award additional dices. Do not remove dices as penalty for being
disadvantaged in a given situation, rather add dices to the advantaged
side instead.

## Applying Effort

Whenever the player rolls he may opt to spend effort points. The
player has to declare so, before making the roll. The amount of effort
he wishes to spend must not exceed his remaining effort pool. Each
effort point spent adds an additional dice to the players dice pool.

When applying effort for movement in combat, a character can only use
as much effort as the character has speed.

It is possible to apply effort to a melee attack. Each effort point spent
adds 2 points of damage to the melee attack.
