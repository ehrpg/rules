            "text": "Introduction\n\n\nThis section will guide you through the character creation. Characters in\nEndless Horizons are your average Joe and Jane, that fight for survival in\nthe ultimate hostile environment: space.\n\n\nCharacter Creation Points\n\n\nAll characters are built and advanced with Character Creation Points (CCP).\nYou receive a given amount, specified by your game master at the start of the\ncampaign, and you receive more as you go through the campaign. They are\nawarded as your character defeats enemies, finish quests and get over the\ndangers in the galaxy.\n\n\nWith CCP you can buy ability increases, improve skills, and even allow you to\nget special features and perks for your character.\n\n\nFor most games you will start with 50 CCP. But it is always up to the game\nmaster, and he or she might adjust the number to fit the theme of his game.\n\n\nAbilities\n\n\nThe character has six major abilities, and they define your overall tone of the\ncharacter. These abilities have ranks from one to ten, with the average being\nfive. Each ability also has a modifier, which determines if you gain a benefit\nor a disadvantage from your ability rank. The rank is determined whether you are\nabove or below the average of five. For each rank above the average, you gain\none positive modifier, and for each rank below average you gain a minus rank.\n\n\nFor example Jack has a seven strength, which means he has a plus two modifier\nin strength. Whenever Jack does a task related to strength, he can add the plus\ntwo modifier to his roll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrength\n: Strength represents your raw physical power. It determines not\nonly how much a character can lift, drag or push; but also how far he can jump,\nor how much damage he does in melee combat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDexterity\n: Dexterity determines your characters fine motor skills and how\nwell your hand-eye coordination is. It is used in combat with fire arms, and\nother skills that require a steady hand, such as piloting a vessel or performing\nsurgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstitution\n: Constitution determines the physical wellness of your\ncharacter. It determines your hit points, as well as endurance and overall\nfitness and health of your character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence\n: Intelligence represents how well and fast your character\nlearns, how well he can think logically, or in abstract terms. It is important\nfor the sciences and other academic fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerception\n: Perception is the awareness of your character. It describes\nhow well your character can describe his surroundings, either passively or\nactively. It determines how well the character finds things that are hidden,\nor notices danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharisma\n: Charisma determines how well your character can interact with\nothers. This includes force of personality, speech articulation and expressions.\nIt is not just the overall beauty of a character, but also his appearance and\ncharm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRanks\n\n\nYour average person has five in all abilities. This means that said person is\nparticularly good but also not bad at these abilities. A six means that the\ncharacter has spent some good amount of training in that area or just has a\nnatural talent for these sorts of things. The average person that goes out\njogging and bicycling a few times a week might have a constitution of six.\nWhile someone who barely does any sports, might have a constitution of four.\n\n\nRanks below three disable your character a lot and you should talk to your\ngame master first about it. At character creation ranks above seven are also\ngenerally prohibited, unless your game master rules otherwise.\n\n\nRaising and lowering\n\n\nRaising an ability score costs exactly as much CCP as the rank you are raising\nthe ability to. For example, if you want to raise strength from five to six, you\nhave to pay six CCP.\n\n\nLowering works the same way, you gain as much CCP as it would cost to raise the\nability to the old value. So if you lower strength from five to four, you\nreceive five CCP.\n\n\nYour Character\n\n\nYour character starts with five in all ability scores. You may then use your\nCCP to adjust these scores to roughly define your character. Notice that scores\nunder three and above seven are prohibited - unless your game master rules\notherwise.\n\n\nSecondary Abilities\n\n\nApart from the primary abilities, your character also has a set of secondary\nabilities. These derive from your the ones above, and also change accordingly\nas they increase or are lowered.\n\n\nHit Points\n\n\nHit Points (HP) are an abstraction of your characters physical well being and\nremaining health. As your character takes damage he or she loses hit points.\nIf your character reaches the negative value of your maximum hit points your\ncharacter is dead. Below zero hit points your character is usually negatively\nimpacted, or even unconscious.\n\n\nA character's hit points are calculated by adding the ranks of constitution and\nstrength to 25.\n\n\n\nHP = \n25\n \n+ CON\n \n+ STR\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nSpeed is the amount of movement your character can do as part of action. It\nis derived by adding the dexterity and strength modifier together and then add\nfive. A character with zero speed points left is unable to move unless he\napplies effort.\n\n\nEffort\n\n\nEffort a pool the represents how much additional effort a character can put into\ntasks and skill checks. Applying effort means going above and beyond what the\ncharacter is usually capable of doing, usually by pushing him or her to the\nlimit. It is determined by adding the modifier of strength and constitution\ntogether and multiplying them by two. This value is then added to the base of\nten.\n\n\nWhenever you do a skill check, do movement using speed or try to damage someone\nin melee you can spend effort to boost that skill.\n\n\nCarrying Capacity\n\n\nThe maximum weight a character can carry for a longer period of time is defined\nby adding the character's constitution and strength rank to 10. The result is\nthe amount of kgs the character carry around with him.\n\n\nPick a Background\n\n\nIn Endless Horizons your character learns skills that define what he or she is\ngood at. Backgrounds are just a set of predefined skills that fit to a certain\ntheme, education or training your character could have received. They are\noptional, however, and experienced players might wish to pick skills for their\ncharacter individually.\n\n\nBackgrounds are designed to help you get started with creating your character,\nbut shouldn't limit you in the possibilities. If you feel that none of the\nbackgrounds fit, and you do not wish to pick the skills on your own you should\ntalk to your game master. A game master can create new backgrounds for you.\n\n\nA background usually comes with an ability increase. This increase stacks with\nyour changes in abilities you made already. A background also comes with\nseveral skills unlocked and raised to certain ranks.\n\n\nYou are free to select more tan one background, but neither the skills nor the\nability increases stack with each other. Only the highest one applies.\n\n\nPick Skills\n\n\nEach skill your character wishes to learn has to be unlocked. Unlocking costs\none, for normal skills, and then CCP for special skills. Special skills\ntake longer to learn than other skills, or even require special training,\nteachers or a training facility. For example studying medicine takes years,\nand being a decent pilot requires training on a simulator for months.",

The player adds relevant bonuses from his her character,\nwhile the game master calculates the difficulty. If the player's result is\nat or above the difficulty the check is successful.\n\n\nIf the player rolls a one (1) or a ten (10) he has caused the dice to escalate.\nThe player rolls again until either he rolls a number that is not one or ten,\nor until he has rolled three times in total.

Whether it be operating a vehicle, shooting a\nfirearm, climbing a steep cliff or trying to convince another character or\nNPC. Each skill is associated with two abilities. If a skill check is made,\na trained character can add the modifier of those abilities to his roll.\n\n\nSome skills are special, as in they require a lot of effort to learn and use\nright, or require special materials, trainers or facilities to learn properly.\nThere are also speciality skills. These skills cannot be learned on their own,\nbut reflect a specialisation of an already existing skill. They help to\nspecialise and refine a character.\n\n\nEach skill has a rank that goes from zero to ten. With zero meaning that the\ncharacter has just learned the skill and cannot draw upon any experience when\nperforming tasks. Ten represents absolute mastery.\n\n\nLearning new skills\n\n\nNormal skills take one CCP to unlock, upon which the skill has a rank of\nzero. If the skill is a special skill, the unlock costs are ten CCP instead.\n\n\nOnce the skill is learned, rank increases can be bought with the same exact\nnumber of CCP as the next rank.\n\n\nUsing skills\n\n\nEach task, against which your skill is pitched against, has a base difficulty.\nIf the base difficulty is at or below your skill level you may be able to\nperform the task without rolling your dice in come circumstances. This means\nthat your character can perform this task given enough time and no adverse\nexternal influences.\n\n\nFor example, an avid shooter can always hit his target on his range, if he's\nrested and aims long enough. But this doesn't mean he can hit another target\non the same distance as easy in the heat of combat, fatigued by days of\nfighting. As soon as external influences come into affect, you \nhave to roll\n.\n\n\nIf you have unlocked a skill you make a skill check rolling a ten-sided dice,\nadding the appropriate ability modifiers, adding the skill rank and adding any\nspecialised skill ranks (if applicable).\n\n\nIf you have not unlocked the skill you simply roll a ten-sided dice and only\nadd negative ability modifiers to the roll.\n\n\nWhen your result exceeds or is equal to the tasks difficulty (which is the base\ndifficulty, plus any situational hindrances) you succeed. Please see tasks and\n\nChecks and Difficulties\n for rules on causing minor, medium or major\nsuccesses or failures.\n\n\nAvailable skills\n\n\nBelow you will find a list of all the base skills available in game. It is of\ncourse up the GM to adapt or add to the list below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcrobatics\n: With acrobatics you can perform such acts as rope\n  walking, tumbling or other specialised manoeuvres. Uses \nDexterity\n and\n  \nConstitution\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActing\n: The ability to play a role and successfully emulate behaviours,\n  emotions and character traits. Uses \nCharisma\n and \nIntelligence\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimbing\n: Allows you to climb walls, cliffs and other obstacles. It\n  helps with finding the right footing while doing so. Uses \nStrength\n\n  and \nConstitution\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDodging\n: A basic combat skill to move out of harm's way. It can be\n  used as an action to avoid getting hit in melee combat, as well as for\n  \"hitting the deck\" in case of incoming enemy fire. Uses \nDexterity\n\n  and \nPerception\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving\n: Driving involves operating and steering land vehicles (such as\n  cars, trucks or motorcycles). Driving also includes heavy machinery such as\n  skid loaders and tracked vehicles (tanks). To fire a tank however, please see\n  the \nHeavy Weapons\n skill. It uses \nPerception\n and \nDexterity\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering (Any) (Special)\n: You have studied the art of applying\n  mathematics, science and knowledge of materials to craft and construct\n  devices, buildings and all other sorts of man made constructs. It uses\n  \nIntelligence\n and \nIntelligence\n.

            "text": "This chapter deals with ranged and melee combat between characters. Ship to ship\ncombat is defined in its own section in the chapter that deals with Vessels.\n\n\nActions\n\n\nEvery participant in combat may choose to take three actions per turn. The\nparticipant can take 1 \naction\n, 1 \nreaction\n and 1 \nfree action\n. Perks,\nitems or other specialties of a character may modify the amount of actions he\nor she may take.\n\n\nActions are activities the player may choose to perform during his turn. Be it\nshooting or aiming a firearm, performing a skill check or running across a\nhallway to reach an elevator. Valid actions are:\n\n\n\n\nUse the character's speed points for movement.\n\n\nUse a non-complicated item, like reloading a firearm, pull the pin and\n  throwing a grenade etc.\n\n\nAttack an enemy.\n\n\nAim at an enemy.\n\n\nPerform a skill check.\n\n\n\n\nA \nreaction\n is an action that is only performed if a certain condition is\nfulfilled. The reaction is valid until the next turn of the character who\ndeclared it. If its condition does not kick in, the action is lost. If the\ncondition kicks, in the player begins his action during the action that\ntriggered it.\n\n\nSometimes the game master may wish to declare a contest between the participant\nthat does the action and the one that does the reaction. For example, one\nparticipant has a reaction in place to draw his gun, if the opponent reaches\nfor his firearm. The game master decides that a dexterity challenge is required\nto determine who draws first. Both players roll a ten sided dice and add any\ndexterity modifier to the result. The participant with the highest result\nwins and draws his gun before the other.\n\n\nFree actions are small actions that take little to no time. Usually only\none free action is allowed per turn. Talking up to ten words is considered a\nfree action.\n\n\nMovement\n\n\nA character can use his available speed points as part of an action to move\nabout in the battle field. The general rule is that, for each point of speed\navailable to the character he may move one metre.\n\n\nCertain actions use up more than speed points than others. See the table below\nto determine how many speed points are expended for various actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nMovement points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovement\n\n\n1 per metre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n1 per two metres\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumping\n\n\n2 per metre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumping (running headstart)\n\n\n1 per metre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrawling\n\n\n2 per metre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimbing\n\n\n3 per metre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging combat stance\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange stance from prone\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen changing stance a character has to expend one speed point. If the character\nis \nprone\n he has to expend two speed points to exchange stance.\n\n\nAny terrain that hinders a persons movement is considered \ndifficult terrain\n.\nSuch terrain doubles the amount of speed points needed for any sort of movement,\nexcept changing stance. The following are examples of difficult terrain: stairs,\nuphill slopes, snow, mudd or wet surfaces.\n\n\nIf a character is out of speed points the character cannot move anymore. He\nmay however spend one of his actions in a round to regain his speed points.\n\n\nA character can use effort points in case of speed points, or if the character\nis out speed points. Effort points can also be used in addition to speed points,\nif the character does not have enough to complete a movement. For example if\nthe character has to run for three metres, and then make a one metre jump across\na cavern, but only has 2 speed points left; he may chose to take the remaining\ntwo from his effort pool.\n\n\nTurns\n\n\nCombat takes place in turns. Each player plots what he wishes to do, and\ncommunicates this to the GM. A player may plot all of his actions (as stated\nabove).\n\n\nUpon all players have decided upon their actions and informed the GM, each\nplayer rolls initiative to see when he gets to act. Rolling initiative is done\nby rolling a ten sided die (d10) and adding the \ndexterity\n modifier and\nany other relevant bonuses. Then all player characters do their actions in the\norder they rolled initiative. Non player characters behave in the same way,\nand also reroll their initiative each round. Everyone may chose to spend effort\npoints, with each spent effort point increasing the initiative by one. This must\nbe done before rolling for initiative.\n\n\nIn an alternate system (as preferred by Johannes) each participant of combat\nrolls their initiative at the beginning, which then remains fixed throughout the\nencounter. This system is preferable if you find that your encounters last too\nlong and you wish to speed them up.\n\n\nSurprise Round\n\n\nOne side of the encounter can initiate a surprise round, if the other side of\nthe encounter is unaware. The surprising round gains one full round, in which\nthe surprised side cannot use any actions. After that surprise round, the\nencounter continues normally.\n\n\nMelee Combat\n\n\nA player character can engage another in melee combat if they are close to each\nother (up to a metre). To attack another opponent in melee roll a skill check\nof the \nMelee Combat\n skill. If it counts as a \nsurprise attack\n the\nopponent is not allowed to dodge or block and must take the attack. If attacker\nhits, he rolls for damage. See the equipment section for weapons and their\ndamage.\n\n\nIf the opponent is aware of the attack he may now use one of his actions this\nround to dodge the attack. If he has no more actions left, he cannot dodge. To\ndodge the attack the opponent makes a \nDodge\n check against the attacker's\nattack check. If the defender exceeds the attack roll he has successfully evaded\nthe attack and takes no damage.\n\n\nShould the opponent be out of actions for this turn, he may only block the\nattack. The opponent rolls a ten sided die (d10) and adds \nStrength\n and\n\nConstitution\n modifiers to the dice result. If he exceeds the attack roll,\nhe has successfully blocked the attack, and damage received is halved. Otherwise\nthe damage is taken in full.\n\n\nRanged Combat\n\n\nRanged combat works differently. A player chooses to engage another in ranged\ncombat, takes aim and fires. The player who is being targeted has no chance\nusually has little change to evade (except on extreme distances). The difficulty\nof landing a successful hit depends on several factors:\n\n\n\n\nSize: The difficulty increases if the target is smaller or decreases if the\ntarget is bigger.\n\n\nRange: Depending on the weapon in question, targets get harder to hit at\nlonger ranges.\n\n\nStances: Various stances can decrease the difficulty. A person firing a\nfully automatic rifle while standing, has a low chance of hitting than a\nperson who fires single shots from the prone position.\n\n\nMovement: A moving target is hard to hit, especially at further ranges. This\nalso applies if the shooter is moving while trying to aim.\n\n\nEnvironmental: Darkness, strong winds and impaired vision can all affect on how\nwell a character can hit a target.\n\n\n\n\nThe game master calculates the difficulty of the task depending on these factors\nand player rolls an appropriate skill check. If he reaches it or exceeds the\ndifficulty he scores a hit.\n\n\nCover\n\n\nThe best way to protect oneself from fire is to hide beneath or behind cover.\nDepending on the material of the cover bullets may still be able to penetrate\nthe cover and cause damage to the people behind the cover.\n\n\nFor example most bullets can penetrate a wooden cover, whereas a .50 BMG is even\ncapable of tearing through brick walls.\n\n\nSize\n\n\nThe game separates targets into size categories. An average human standing is\nconsidered a \nmedium\n target. The same average human that is either sitting on\nthe floor or kneeling is considered a \nsmall\n target. The same person in the\nprone position is considered \ntiny\n. These size categories do not change\ndepending on the distance from the shooter. They just help to categorize the\ntargets. For example a big dog would be considered a \nsmall\n target, while a\nsneaking would count as \ntiny\n.\n\n\nTargets larger than a human also have their own size categories. A car, for\nexample is considered a \nlarge\n target. So are some other vehicles that fit\nroughly the same size. Bigger targets are considered \nhuge\n, for example large\nvehicles (main battle tanks, MRAPs, IVFs) or even space ships.\n\n\nRange\n\n\nThe range to a target is always given rough estimate in metres. The game master\nshould avoid making a science of it, and should operate in rough estimates.\n\n\nThe gun play mechanics then categorize these ranges into what is called an\n\neffective range\n. This is a metric used in conjunction\nwith firearms to determine how effective they are at certain ranges. The authors\nknow that firearms are more complicated than that, and much of it depends on the\nskill of the shooter involved. Still this metric is used for abstraction and for\nbalancing reasons.\n\n\nThe \neffective range\n is broadly defined as the distance an average shooter\nshould be able to hit a \nmedium\n target half of the time. Other ranges are\nderived from this in fractions:\n\n\n\n\nMaximum\n: Between \neffective range\n and half the \neffective range\n.\n\n\nFar\n: Between \nmaximum\n and a quarter of the \neffective range\n.\n\n\nMedium\n: Between \nfar\n and an eights of the \neffective range\n.\n\n\nClose\n: Below an eights of the \neffective range\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, let's assume a Glock 17 has an effective range of 50 metres. The\nranges are thus as following: \nMaximum\n is between 50 and 25 metres. \nFar\n\nbetween 25 and 12.5 metres. \nMedium\n between 12.5 metres and six metres, and\n\nclose\n is everything closer than six metres.\n\n\nThe size category of the target and the range category are combined and lead\nto the following table of penalties for the difficulty task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nClose\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nFar\n\n\nMaximum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiny\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n+1\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n-12\n\n\n-8\n\n\n-4\n\n\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge\n\n\n-18\n\n\n-12\n\n\n-6\n\n\n-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovement\n\n\nMovement is also categorized into four categories: \nstill\n, \nsubtle\n, \nslow\n\nand \nfast\n. A normal human being standing is considered moving \nsubtly\n as no\nperson normally stands perfectly still. Objects may as well stand perfectly\n\nstill\n, as in their movement is not noticeable. So do living beings who are\nperhaps bound, unconscious or otherwise incapable of moving. \nSlow\n movement\nincorporates anything at the speed of an average human walking. \nFast\n is\nanything that moves at a speed of an average human sprinting or above.\n\n\nThe penalties are as followed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill\n\n\nSubtle\n\n\nSlow\n\n\nFast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2\n\n\n0\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese penalties apply for both a moving target, and a shooter that is moving. So\na player who is running and shooting at a target that is also running as a\ncumulative penalty of plus eight (+8).\n\n\nStance\n\n\nA person firing can be in one of the following firing stances: \nstanding\n,\n\nkneeling\n, \nprone firing\n, and \nprone\n. Standing also makes the person in\nquestion a medium target, \nkneeling\n makes him a small and \nprone\n and\n\nprone firing\n a tiny target.\n\n\nThe difference between \nprone\n and \nprone firing\n is that a prone firing is an\nactual rifle stance. The prone firing position gives an aiming advantage,\nwhile prone does not. If a person falls on the floor, or is knocked down he is\nconsidered \nprone\n instead of being in the \nprone firing\n position.\n\n\nThe penalties for the stances are as followed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStance\n\n\nPenalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKneeling\n\n\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProne firing\n\n\n-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProne\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking Aim\n\n\nA character is always considered to at least raise is weapon, aim shortly and\nthe fire by default.\n\n\nBut a character may expend an action to take careful aim. The difficulty is\nreduced by two (2) for each action he chooses to take aim for. The bonus is lost\nif he doesn't fire in the same round he also take aim for.\n\n\nBursts and Full Auto\n\n\nEach weapon which is capable of burst firing or fully automatic has a recoil\nmodifier. Each subsequent bullet adds this recoil modifier to the difficulty.\nRegardless only one attack roll is made for the burst. As many bullets of the\nburst hit as the attack roll meets or exceeds in difficulty. While the\nprogression is linear (per bullet) in a real life scenario it is perfectly\nreasonable for the first bullet to hit, the second to miss and the third to\nhit again.\n\n\nExample: A player wishes to shoot a three round burst at a target. The\ndifficulty is determined to be 16 and the recoil modifier of the gun is 2.\nThe player rolls a 19. This means that the first bullet (difficulty 16) hits,\nthe second does as well (as the player's 19 is above 16 plus 2) but the third\nbullet does not (19 is below 20).\n\n\nSuppressing Fire\n\n\nSometimes it is necessary to keep the enemy sitting ducks. Usually to allow\nsomeone else to flank around, or to cover the get away of others. With\nsuppressing fire you have to fire a certain amount bullets towards the\nenemies you wish to suppress for each action you wish to suppress them. This\nincludes your actions, those of your allies and the actions of the enemy. The\namount of bullets required is determined by the game master. Depending on the\nsituation. The game master may even allow you to fire and aim at an enemy out of\nturn if they leave their cover while you suppress them.\n\n\nIf you run out of bullets and have to reload you have to await your turn to\nreload and the suppression ends.\n\n\nThe game master has to determine the bullets required. For example, covering a\nsimple narrow corridor (with enemies left and right of the door) usually\nrequires just one bullets per action. While a wide open area with natural\ncover and enemies advancing may require a short burst per cover.\n\n\nThe rule of thumb is, that one shooter with one bullet per action can\neffectively suppress one lane of attack (i.e. one hallway, one street). If\nthe area is wide and open, a small burst (of three to five bullets) is usually\nrequired to keep one group of advancing enemies at bay.\n\n\nDespite common misconception it is not required to fire full auto to achieve\na suppression effect. If a sharp shooter covers a narrow side alley and takes\nsingle shots at anyone who wishes to cross, the enemies will still think twice\nbefore crossing.\n\n\nReloading\n\n\nReloading a firearms takes a certain amount of actions. If not otherwise noted\nin the description of the firearm, it takes one action to reload the firearm.\n\n\nIf the firearm uses magazines, that means swapping the empty magazine for a new\none and cocking the gun. Reloading magazines themselves is generally not\npossible during a firefight.\n\n\nDrawing\n\n\nDrawing a pistol or a knife from a holster takes one action. The same applies\nif you carry the pistol or knife conceiled on your body (but still using a\nholster). The same applies if you carry the knife or the pistol in a slot of\na body armor.\n\n\nIf the weapon is not in a slot of an armor, or in a holster (i.e. hidden in\na boot, in your pocket, a rucksack or shouldered) it takes two actions to\ndraw the weapon.\n\n\nHiding\n\n\nYou can hide small weapons (Pistols, PDWs) on your body. This is not the same\nas doing conceiled carry. Use your \nstealth\n skill to hide the weapon on\nyour body. Anybody searching you must use an apposing \nnotice\n check to\nfind the hidden weapon on you, but gains a -5 on his difficulty task, as finding\na weapon is easier than hiding one. If someone wishes to determine from a\ndistance if you are armed or not, he must also make a \nnotice\n check, but does\nnot gain any benefit.\n\n\nMalfunctions\n\n\nFirearms are mechanical devices that can fail. Wear and tear, or inproper\ncleaning and handling can contribute to these malfunctions or stoppages. There\nare variety of possible malfunctions, ranging from temporary to relative save\nmalfunctions to potentially dangerous ones that can permanently damage the gun\nor cause injury or death.\n\n\nThese malfunctions are candidates for minor or medium negative effects.\n\n\nA minor fault is a \nfailure to feed\n (FTF) when the firearm fails to feed\nthe next cartridge into the chamber from a magazine. It can also be caused by\nnot holding the fire arm properly (``limp wristing''). It can usually be cleared\nin one action and does not immediately threaten the shooter. It does however\nstop a burst or fully automatic fire.\n\n\nA stovepipe (\nfailure to eject\n) occours when the spent casing is not\nproperly ejected from the firearm, causing it to jam the ejection port. It\npresents no immediate danger to the shooter and can be cleared in one action. It\ndoes however stop a burst or fully automatic fire.\n\n\nA severe major fault is a so called \nsquib load\n where the projectile does\nnot have enough force to exit the barrel and becomes stuck. A subsequent bullet\nfired afterwards can cause catastrophic failure, causing damage to the firearm\nand injury to the shooter.\n\n\nDetermining Difficulty\n\n\nThe base difficulty for ranged attacks is five (5). Then you combine the size\ncategory and the range category and add it. Then you add a movement penalty,\nif the target is moving or the shooter is moving. Then you add stance modifiers,\nany environmental modifiers and any miscellaneous modifiers.\n\n\nExample\n: A player wishes to fire a three round burst with his rifle\n(recoil modifier of 2) (range 300 metres) at a small target roughly 100 metres\nout. It is dusk and the game master decides that he has an additional penalty\nof +2 for from low light conditions. The player as a dexterity and perception\nmodifier of +1, and three ranks in the appropriate skill. The difficulty is\ndetermined as following:\n\n\n\nDC = \n5\n\n\n+ 8\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n- 1\n\n= 13\n\n\n\n\nThe player rolls the following:\n\n\n\n1d10 = \n8\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n+ 3\n\n= 13\n\n\n\n\nAnd scores one hit. The other two of his bullets miss.\n\n\nThrown Weapons\n\n\nThrown weapons (throwing knives, axes and hand grenades) are handled just like\nother ranged weapons, except that a different skill is used in the checks:\n\nThrowing\n. Thrown weapons also have an \neffective range\n and cause\ndamage just like a bullet from a firearm would.\n\n\nGrenades\n\n\nThrowing a grenade at a specific area (for example next or behind a cover) is\nusually considered a range task with a \nmedium\n target (the area). Any special\ncircumstances might reduce or widen the size. For example throwing a grenade\ninto a window would cause the target to be \nsmall\n (for a small window), or\ncasting a grenade into a small man-hole might even be considered a \ntiny\n\ntarget.\n\n\nMost hand held explosive grenades have what is called an \neffective\n and an\n\ncasualty\n radius. Everyone within the \neffective\n radius, that is not\nprotected by grenade proof cover, dies. Within the \ncasualty\n radius a grenade\ndeals enough damage to kill or incapacitate all of the targets.\n\n\nGrenades cause two types of damage: \nbludgeoning\n from the explosive shock\nwave, and piercing \npiercing\n from the flying shrapnel. Due to the massive\namounts of shrapnel only full cover or full body armour can protect against\nthe piercing damage.\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nThe weapon used always determines the amount and type of damage that can be\ncaused to another. A knife for example can deal piercing or slashing damage\ndepending how it's being used. A firearm usually causes piercing and\nbludgeoning damage. Hits with bare fists may just cause bludgeoning damage.\n\n\nOther forms of damage are of course also possible, for example a player can\ntake fire damage from an open flame, or acid damage from being exposed to\nacids or other corrosive fluids.\n\n\nZones\n\n\nWhen a player hits another, either with a ranged or melee weapon, the attacking\nplayer rolls two six sided die (2d6) to determine where he scores a hit.\n\n\nThe target then determines if he has clothing or armor that protects him in this\nregion and substracts any relevant damage reductions from the incoming damage.\nIf any damage is left the target resolves any effects of the target area (for\nexample damage multiplier) and substracts that number from his hit points.\n\n\nIf the target survives it, he then has to roll another check to see if the\ninjury causes a wound. See the chapter \nInjury and Death\n regarding rules\nfor wounds.\n\n\nAiming for a specific zone is possible. The size modifier of the target is\nreduced one step any body part except the vital organs, and by two steps for\nvital organs. If the reduction is not possible because the size modifier would\nbe beneath \"tiny\" then aiming at it the zone specifically is not possible. If\nthe attack succeeds the zone is hit automatically without a need to roll the two\nsix sided dices.\n\n\nThe following is a hit zone for a human or human-like creature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nZone\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nVital Organ\n\n\nSpecial, Damage * 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3,4\n\n\nLegs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,6,7\n\n\nTorso\n\n\nDamage * 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8,9\n\n\nArms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10, 11\n\n\nHead\n\n\nDamage * 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nVital Organ\n\n\nSpecial, Damage * 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVital Organs\n\n\nMost creatures, animals (including humans) have vital organs. Any damage\nto those areas is usually fatal. For humans these areas would be the brain\nand the heart. Damage to the vital organs follows special rules, usually\ndepending on the creature involved. However if - after applying these special\nrules - any damage is done to the vital organ this damage is multiplied by\nsix (6).\n\n\nHumans\n\n\nHumans have two vital organs: The \nheart\n and the \nbrain\n. Both the brain and\nthe heart are usually protected either by the skull or the rib cage. Any\nbludgeoning damage below \nten\n (10) is automatically converted into a hit\ntowards the surrounding hit zone (torso for heart, and head for\nbrain). Slashing damage cannot harm either of those vital two organs unless\nthey are exposed. Any piercing damage above \ntwo\n (2) can easily penetrate the\nrib cage or skull and does full damage. Any piercing damage below \ntwo\n is\nstopped by the bone and negated.",

The authors\nknow that firearms are more complicated than that, and much of it depends on the\nskill of the shooter involved. Still this metric is used for abstraction and for\nbalancing reasons.  The  effective range  is broadly defined as the distance an average shooter\nshould be able to hit a  medium  target half of the time.

Trying to convince\nsomeone else that your own viewpoint is right, is one example. A player can\nachieve this in many different ways: He can use deceit, intimidation or by\nsimply trying to talk and arguing the point.\n\n\nThe player decides what he wishes to do and the game master decides the DC. For\neach instance of interaction a separate roll is needed. If more than one roll\nis involved it is common that a few among them might fail.

A game master may also forgo to use the morale system at all in his\ncampaign.\n\n\nInfluencing Morale\n\n\nMorale can be influenced by successful or failed social checks. For example\na successful Oratory check can increase or restore morale.

Most blade weapons allow for either slashing\ndamage or piercing damage and a player may select what he wishes to do (i.e.\nslash or try stab the opponent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nCost\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife\n\n\n2d8\n\n\n100\n\n\nCombat knife\n\n\n0.3kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSword\n\n\n3d8\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n\n1.5kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaton\n\n\n2d8\n\n\n150\n\n\nDeals bludgeoning damage\n\n\n0.5kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrowing Knife\n\n\n2d6\n\n\n50\n\n\nCan be thrown, 20m effective range\n\n\n0.2kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrowing Axe\n\n\n2d6\n\n\n50\n\n\nCan be thrown, 20m effective range\n\n\n0.2kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmour does protect against knife and sword slashes, and every metal plate\nalso stops the blade from piercing into the body. Kevlar however cannot stop\na piercing blade.\n\n\nFirearms\n\n\nThis section lists all available firearms. Each firearm uses a magazine to feed\n(be it internally or externally detachable) and fires some sort of cartridge.\nDifferent firearms use different calibres, and for each calibre different\nammunition is available. Most of the time these are normal, hollow point (for\nincreased effectiveness non-armoured targets) and armour piercing (for more\ndamage against armour.\n\n\nIf a firearm is not listed in the section and your players wishes to use it,\njust add them. This list is not exhaustive for the massive amounts of available\nfirearms in the world today.\n\n\nMagazines\n\n\nMany modern firearms (especially handguns, rifles) come with detachable box\nmagazines. These are most commonly not interchangeable between firearms unless\nexplicitly noted. Many firearms also come with internal magazines, for example\nmany pump action shotguns come with an internal magazine. Another good example\nare revolvers.\n\n\nMagazines are cheap to come by, and usually cost a tenth of the firearm they\nbelong to.\n\n\nIt is up to the player to manage, reload and maintain his magazines. It is not\npossible to reload a magazine during combat but if spare bullets are available\nmagazines can be reloaded during downtime (travel with a shuttle etc.).\n\n\nFiring Modes\n\n\nMost fire arms are single action (meaning one trigger pull fires one bullet).\nBut many also come with burst (one trigger pull fires multiple bullets) or\neven fully automatic. The modes that are available depends on the firearm or\neven sometimes on the model of a specific firearm.\n\n\nThe table lists modes with abbreviations. \nS\n stands for single shot,\n\nB\n stands for burst (three round burst unless otherwise noted), \nA\n\nstands for automatic, and \nR\n stands for repeating, meaning that a\nmechanism has to be operated to cycle the next round into the chamber.\n\n\nCartridges\n\n\nEach firearm fires a certain calibre. The bullet defines the damage that is\ndone, while the firearm describes additional characteristics such as effective\nrange, fire-modes and more. Many cartridges come in different variations, such\nas normal, sub sonic, tracer; and may come with different bullets (hollow\npoint, armour penetrating steel tip). Down below is a list of cartridges that\nare currently available in \nEndless Horizons\n.\n\n\nEach bullet deals piercing and bludgeoning damage to a target. The piercing\ndamage represents the wound canal, and the bludgeoning damage represents the\nkinetic energy transfer to internal organs and tissue.\n\n\nThe cost and weight is for the given amounts of rounds.\n\n\nPistol Cartridges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCartridge\n\n\nType\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nCost\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9x18\n\n\nNormal\n\n\n1d4/1d4\n\n\n10 (50

Slots are used to wear equipment directly on the body\nfor easy access. Slots could be pockets on trousers or jackets, or holsters that\nare carried on a belt.\n\n\nThere are three types of slots:\n\n\n\n\nArmour slots\n: They provide a possibility to insert protective plating\n(see below for list of available armour plates).\n\n\nFast access slots\n or \nFA slots\n are slots that are meant to be\naccessed quickly by the wearer. Pouches on a chest carrier or holsters usually\ncome with a few \nFA slots\n to allow for fast access to guns, ammunition\nor other useful items. Accessing a \nFA slot\n takes a swift action.\n\n\nMisc. slots\n are slots that can store equipment but are not as easily\naccessed as \nFA slots\n. Accessing them takes a normal action. Examples\nfor \nmisc. slots\n are pockets on trousers or jackets.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing other items (for example in a bag or backpack) usually takes two\nactions or longer.\n\n\nClothing\n\n\nNormal clothing is usually not listed in this chapter. It is deemed as\ntoo unimportant to list prices or weight. They are readily available\nin most stores for little money (ranging from two to ten credits).\n\n\nHowever, both pants and jackets provide misc slots. Pants are considered to\nprovide 2 \nmisc. slots\n, and jackets usually also provide 2 \nmisc. slots\n.\n\n\nA special case are leather holsters or belts, which provide one 1 \nfast access\nslot\n and 2 \nmisc. slots\n.\n\n\nBody Armour\n\n\nBody armour comes in many different shapes and sizes. The most common are metal\nplates that are inserted into what is called a \"chest carrier\". These plates\nthen stop the bullets from entering and absorb some of the force of the bullet.\nThe armour usually covers the most vital part of body (i.e. the chest and back)\nand come with a specific rating. If a specified calibre is stopped by the\narmour the target takes only half the bludgeoning damage instead. The rest of\nthe damage is absorbed by the armour. Yet if the armour reaches zero hit points\nit stops being effective. If the bullet is not stopped by armour, both the\narmour and person being hit take equal amounts of damage.\n\n\nArmour is classified into various \ntiers\n determining what kinds of threats\nit stops. Please see the calibres to see what kind of armour tier a specific\ncalibre penetrates. All armour is capable of defending a player from slashing\ndamage from knives and other small blades or thrown weapons.\n\n\nAll plates require a carrier. The kevlar vest has protection for both front\nand back (both for 40 hit points) and cannot be worn in combination with a\nchest carrier, except for the FREJ MK I tactical vest (see below). You also\ncannot carry more than one tactical vest, plate carrier or kevlar armour on\nthe torso at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmour\n\n\nClass\n\n\nHP\n\n\nCost\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevlar Vest\n\n\nI\n\n\n20\n\n\n100\n\n\n2.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class I\n\n\nI\n\n\n30\n\n\n100\n\n\n1.5kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class II\n\n\nII\n\n\n40\n\n\n150\n\n\n2.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class III\n\n\nIII\n\n\n50\n\n\n250\n\n\n3.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class IV\n\n\nIV\n\n\n60\n\n\n350\n\n\n3.5kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class V\n\n\nV\n\n\n70\n\n\n450\n\n\n3.8kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Class VI\n\n\nVI\n\n\n80\n\n\n550\n\n\n4.3kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChest Carries\n\n\nThe most commonly used armour is a plate and chest carrier with armour plates\ninserted. The carrier has slots for usually several armour plates and comes\nwith pouches where the player can quickly access certain gear (such as\nmagazines, grenades and other useful items). The first armour slot is for the\nfront, the second armour slot protects the back, and the third protects the\nwearer's left and the fourth the wearer's right side of the torso. Plates for\nthe wearer's left and right torso weigh and cost only half but also absorb only\nhalf the amount of damage.\n\n\nThe slots can be filled with various accessories, while the armour slots are\nfor armour plates.\n\n\nThe weight is given unloaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nArmour Slots\n\n\nFA Slots\n\n\nCost\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFREJ MK I\n\n\n0\n\n\n4\n\n\n200\n\n\n0.4kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFREJ MK II\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n400\n\n\n0.6kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHOR MK I\n\n\n2\n\n\n8\n\n\n900\n\n\n1.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHOR MK II\n\n\n4\n\n\n12\n\n\n1200\n\n\n1.2kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuits\n\n\nSuits are whole-body garment that protects against hazardous materials, and\nalways come with a self-contained breathing apparatus. They're used when dealing\nwith hazardous environments or in a vacuum (such as space).\n\n\nAll suits come with head lamps, magnetic boots, an integrated radio for\ncommunications and a head camera. The head camera transmits the field of view\nfrom the helmet to a designated target (usually HQ, combat station on a ship or\nthe pilot).\n\n\nAll suits come with a variable amount of internal air storage, and a variable\namount of power supply. See the table for further details. The battery can be\nswitched out during normal operation or recharged at most standard wall power\nplugs.\n\n\nThe suits can be switched to a mode where an external air (either from the\natmosphere, or supplied by cable from an oxygen tank) source is used.  The\ninternal air storage can be changed during operation, or it can be refilled at\nan oxygen station (but not through the atmosphere, as compressed air is needed).\nSwitching an oxygen tank on a suit takes two actions. One action to remove, and\none to insert a new one. A suit without an oxygen tank has roughly 30 seconds of\nair.\n\n\nThe air and power field determine how many hours this suit provides air, and\npower to its systems before they need recharging. A suit without power loses all\nsystems (such as camera, head lamps and mag boots).\n\n\nSome suits come with night-vision (NV) or thermal imaging (TI) or even with\nsmall manoeuvrable thrusters (MT) for micro gravity navigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nArmour Slots\n\n\nFA Slots\n\n\nAir\n\n\nPower\n\n\nCost\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nMisc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSP-99\n\n\n0\n\n\n4\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n500\n\n\n4.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSP-99M\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n800\n\n\n3.5kg\n\n\nNV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEVA MK I\n\n\n2\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n1000\n\n\n8.0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEVA MK II\n\n\n2\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n8\n\n\n1500\n\n\n7.5kg\n\n\nNV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKAT-9\n\n\n4\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n8\n\n\n3500\n\n\n8.0kg\n\n\nNV, TI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKAT-9M\n\n\n4\n\n\n12\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n5000\n\n\n9.0kg\n\n\nNV, TI, MT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplosives\n\n\nGrenades\n\n\nThis section covers hand thrown grenades (hand grenades).

Below 15 metres the grenade does normal damage, and\nbeyond that range it does half. If sturdy enough cover is available remove\nthe piercing damage, as it represents the flying shrapnel.\n\n\nMost hand grenades come with a pin that has to be pulled in order to arm the\ngrenade.

These are\nintended to be used against small armoured vehicles (such as tanks, armored\ntrucks and cars, helicopters or small landing craft). Many of these vary in\nshape, size and cost; but most importantly in how they function.\n\n\nSome are single use only, and are discarded after use, while others can be\nreloaded. The ammunition used also differs from weapon to weapon. The most\nexpensive launcher can fire different kind of ammuntion, for example guided\nmissiles and rockets. Others just shoot unguided dumb fire rockets or rocket\npropelled grenades.\n\n\nWhile these weapons are mostly used to destroy or disable enemy armour, they\ncan also be used to destroy houses or fortification.\n\n\nSome of these weapons require careful handling as they could be potentially\ndangerous to one owns health if used improperly. Some have a considerable and\ndangerous back blast that could kill anyone standing behind the shooter when the\nweapon is fired. The lethal range of such a \nbackblast\n is usually given in\nmetres.

All armour is capable of defending a player from slashing\ndamage from knives and other small blades or thrown weapons.  All plates require a carrier.

They're used when dealing\nwith hazardous environments or in a vacuum (such as space).  All suits come with head lamps, magnetic boots, an integrated radio for\ncommunications and a head camera. The head camera transmits the field of view\nfrom the helmet to a designated target (usually HQ, combat station on a ship or\nthe pilot).  All suits come with a variable amount of internal air storage, and a variable\namount of power supply. See the table for further details. The battery can be\nswitched out during normal operation or recharged at most standard wall power\nplugs.  The suits can be switched to a mode where an external air (either from the\natmosphere, or supplied by cable from an oxygen tank) source is used.  The\ninternal air storage can be changed during operation, or it can be refilled at\nan oxygen station (but not through the atmosphere, as compressed air is needed).\nSwitching an oxygen tank on a suit takes two actions. One action to remove, and\none to insert a new one. A suit without an oxygen tank has roughly 30 seconds of\nair.  The air and power field determine how many hours this suit provides air, and\npower to its systems before they need recharging. A suit without power loses all\nsystems (such as camera, head lamps and mag boots).
